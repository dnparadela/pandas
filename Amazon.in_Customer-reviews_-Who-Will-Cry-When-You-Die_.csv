‚Ü™The entire book is just about those small changes that we can apply to our lives to bring that happiness that we always longed to bring or see.
‚Ü™ Collection of these thoughts what makes this book as an unique and inspiring. You may wonder while reading this book, why didn't I realize these trivial things all these days ?
‚Ü™This book is just about realizing what makes us more happyüòä and less resentful.
‚Ü™I recommend this book to be read by everyone. Though it may not bring overnight changes to your life, but, surely, it evokes some questions that every readers can questions themselves.
‚Ü™The only üíîdisappointment would be, this is more like a life manual & less of a novel."

"Dimpy","5","""I wept because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.""
""Too many people lead small life, we die in our twenties and are buried at eighty. Remember nothing can stop a person who refuses to be stopped. Most people don't really fail; they simply give up trying""

I am not a fan of self-help books. But, this one made me to read more of such books. All thanks to Robin Sharma. It didn't really transform my life overnight, rather, it did allowed me to sit and introspect a bit on what I might be missing in life. Even the title of is enough to think what are you actually doing with your life.

Author has covered every little detail of our daily routine. How can a small change in these little things can bring enormous happiness in our lives. From this book, you will learn an art of living and an art of dying as well."
"shan","4","""When you were born, you cried while the world rejoiced. Live your life such a way that when you die the world cries and you rejoice"". This is the crux of the book written by the author of the bestseller ‚ÄòThe Monk who sold his Ferrari‚Äô who tells one how to lead a prosperous life in a simple, direct and easy-to-read way.The author, though very young, has been able to summon some really good and inspiring unknown as well as known but not practised advice. He guides the readers through his more than a hundred soul-stirring advices focusing on the most basic ones too like getting up early and avoid getting angry which we so easily ignore in the books as well as in our daily lives. Reading them all and practising them is a life-long pursuit and will require strong determination on one‚Äôs goal of self-improvement. The book is all about living life more joyfully, meaningfully and completely.The more no. of times one reads it, the more new meaning emerges of it enlightening one‚Äôs soul. The book is like a guide to be opened up and read randomly whenever one is feeling that they are not living up to their full potential as the advice would surely give one a new way of approaching life."

My Reviews: This was my 1st Self help book I read. Its title attracted me to buy this book.

Why should you buy this book?
1) Each chapter is very small 1-3 page
2) Each chapter provides deeper understanding of life.
3) Written in very simple english
4) Anti-boring book
5) Small size, easy to handle
6) This book contains different types of inspirational quotes
7) It prescribes other similar self help books.

This book gives life lessons from a very famous book ""The monk who sold his Ferrari"" which was written by the same author. Each and every lesson of this book is related to the monk who sold his Ferrari to understand this book even more deeply go through the ""The monk who sold his Ferrari"". You can read whatever book you 1st like to read both those books are related, does not matter which book you 1st choose."
"Krishnendu Das","4","So finally I have completed this book with a full of greatness guides by -@robinsharma Sir. After his  no.1 bestselling ""The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari"" This book contains a series of life lessons from the book mentioned above  to manifest the potential lying most of us within to die vigorously in the world leaving others crying while you are smiling till last breath. I am recommending to all of the aspirants who are willing to change thier lifestyle widely after a full inspiration from a certain sources. Go for it & Chill! Otherwise the years have quietly slipped by and the years will turn into age  and when we'll have to leave the world then we have to wet our face with a burst of tears saying that -""Wish I have an another day in my life"".Robin Sir vividly described the reality of death on a sentence""When you were born you cried while the world rejoiced. Live your life in such a way that when you die,The world cries while you rejoice""üôèüèªüíòüî•."
"Sonia","4","Very nice..awesome book..while reading you don't need to worry about the start or finish of a chapter or book. You open any page ..read any paragraph or lines and you will realise thats making sense and great meaning. Liked it a lot !!"
"Arushi Seth","5","One of the best self-help and self-motivating book I cane across.
All the words are so beautifully written in simple language that it easily makes an impact on your mind.
The best thing is you don't need to read in series just pick any one chapter and you are good to go.
Ever since I have read this book my perception of thinking has changed and I have turned even into a more better person.
A great work by Robin Sharma.
Looking forward to read more of his work."
"sukendu kumar","5","It has 101 lessons to transfer your life from stumbling blocks into stepping stones..Must read book for everyone..Blindly go for it !!"
"Sanjana","5","Being a teenager I do not qualify to write this review but this book has ammended my perspectives to a very large extent. So I want to compel you all to read this book, irrespective of your age. It has hidden treasures buried in it. Whenever I feel stressed or helpless, I grab it and sit in the corner of my room and give it a read.

Not only do I feel refreshed and relaxed but I also find a new driving force inside me to work.
Robin sir has skillfully suggested methods to live a better quality life and die peacefully after leaving a mark in the sands of time with small but significant efforts.
If you are in need of help or want to get a break from your hectic schedule, read it.
That's all.
Thanks! ‚ú®"
"Abhiishek Mohta","4","The novel is all about living life more optimistically, purposely.It is like a guide to reading casually whenever one is thinking they are not breathing up to their full potential as the lesson would assuredly turn on a new way of programming life."
"Chinmay D.","5","Very inspiring chapter's to help you to find the good balance in your life."
"gurpreet","2","When i read The monk who sold his ferrari,  became a big fan of Robin Sharma, but this book is disappointment, chapters are so short that they did not convey the message properly( in my point of).  it seems Sharma g were in hurry while writing this book. The readers who like short stories or short chapters may like it but i dont think that book goes with its heading"
"Thyagarajan P","5","Positive observations:
1. Every chapter in this book are so short & effective and it induces me to read more & more.
That is unique character of this book.
2. The synopsis of this book chapters are so fascinated & it is required to every age of peoples.
3. The wordings & quotations are quite simple & very effective.
4. Some chapters contents are very powerful & I started using your path to reach my destination.
5. It seems to be titbits but the author given all the essential things to everyone.

According to me, every human has to read this book before he start his/her life but atleast before he/ she dies."
"Prashant K","1","Nothing new in this book, just a way for writer to earn money by writing a book from 100 points which are known to everyone & nothing exciting.  For some writers like this one, writing has become money earning profession rather than passion  same like boring  tv serials which keep on adding news episodes without any proper content. Such writers should now stop writing books just for earnings  & do some serious work. I  am getting a feeling that most of the self help books are just like old wine in new bottle. Best self help book is ""How to Stop worrying & start living."" Its simple in language, meaningful , cheaper & not only GYAN  . You just  read this book & start working hard in whatever profession you are into. Whenever you will face problems or tough situations, refer this book & try to enjoy your life as it comes. Stay Safe!!!!!!!!"
"Vivian Ronaldo","4","I generally don't read self-help books. But, this one book made me to read more of such books. Thanks to the author Robin Sharma. It didn't really transform my life in overnight, rather, it did allowed me to sit and introspect a bit on what I might be missing in life. This book is something that reverberates in your mind for a long time, leave alone giving you an idea of what's most important.Favorite quote - ""When you are born the World rejoice while you cry. Live a life in a such a way that when you DIE, the World should cry and you rejoice."""
"Kartik","5","The book is beautifully carved into small chapters which will be easier for a beginner to start with. Amazing life lessons which we all have forgotten in our busy lifestyle. Go for it. You will not be disappointed."
"Brij","5","This is my fire time that I Confronted Mr. Sharma through this book  and I can finally say that this is one of the best self-help book that I have read so far. I was captivated by the title,actually, when I was looking for a self-help book on kindle. It turned out to be a different one than I had thought before buying it but it kept me glued until I finished .Recommend you to read once!!"
"Amazon Customer","5","I purchased this book in 2018 . Also, started it sometime ago but got judgemental after 2-3 chapters and rated it one star with a theme  ' Full of impractical advices ' .Apologies to Robin Sharma for my deed . He wrote an absolute masterpiece . I came back to it again when have nothing to read and I will never regret that in my life .The book consists of 101 ways to enhance your growth,  live a more meaningful and happy life . I used to highlight the chapters I found I can implement easily . That way you can get the most out of it . Also, make sure to come back to it and read it again coz it is not a one time read ( like other self help books ) .All in all , it is a wonderful book and contain ways which are practical .  Text is legible . No issue with quality .10/10 ."
"Sanjay choudhary","4","this is same kind of book as Robin is known for. he gives you different aspect to life and provides the much needed calmness and peace. it gives you great lesson about life and its journey. I loved the mink who sold his ferrai much but you cant just ignore this. its a short book and based on thoughts which are clearly explained in chapters. a good one to read and relax a bit before starting new journey."
"Seema Khandelwal","3","Well, I always loved his books. The monk who sold his Ferrari is my all time fav. But, this book has nothing much to offer. It is all 'Gyan' which we all know. There is nothing new in it. Our parents keeping telling these things to us day and night and I am so bored hearing them that I started hating the book because it just repeats what they told us the whole day.Not interested. May inspire teenagers but not me"
"Dhruv","5","Very good book. I have read first book of Robin Sharma and it is a very good experience. The book has 101 tips & habits which will help one transform his/her life.
However what I missed is some decent guidelines on how to implement these, for instance the book says learn to forgive and it's explains the benefits and reasons that how forgiving will help you but recently I had a very bitter experience with someone and even though I tried but I could not take that thing off my mind. I guess may be this would take sometime and practice, merely reading a book won't help and I should keep trying these things.
After Steven covey's 7 habbit this is second best self help book I have read till now.

Recommended and it is a must read.

Full marks and 5 out of 5 rating."
"mohite tushar","2","Good book but all about observations which is not given right direction for goalSo request to author please write a book with one particular point and don‚Äôt give the own example instead give the example of down to earth people because down to earth people is true hard worker they have to adjust everything form food to education and from family to get secure job."
"Sejal bhardwaj","5","Fantastic book. In this book the author highlight the point bout who will cry when you die . In the very beginning he told that when he grown up then his father told him ''son when you was born you cried and the world rejoiced '' and asked him to live a life in such a way that when you die the world cries and you rejoice. Be something great. Follow your passion, work hard to achieve live a life you are dreaming for üôÇ."
"Kingshuk Biswas","5","First of all, let me tell you, this is not a book that will change your life completely after reading. It will show you the paths to lead a happy and self contented life, that we all people crave for.To sum it up, I would say, ""Simple facts and knowledge of life, that will make a big difference in your life if you apply it!""Remember, Knowledge is not power, but Knowledge used is power, Knowledge not used is garbage.Thanks for reading, have a great day!"
"Lucky Kagra","1","Nothing so interesting as the cover suggests it to comprise, but One cannot deny that it is an Average Book to Trigger yourself towards a better finishing of your Daily Routine Jobs, i.e. it is meant to help you work on, in accordance with some motives, your thoughts."
"Divyansh S","5","A very nice book, amazingly written and highly rated. Bibliophiles will relish reading this book. This book is one of the top bestsellers on Amazon. The book is filled with writer's sentiments and experience."
"Garvit Saini","4","It's very helpful books but more helpful for Foreigner (Non Indian) because in India we daily get to know such lessons by our elders!So this book is only to revise what I daily learn from my elders and grandparents! That's it! I'm also highly obliged to Robin Sharma who contributed in giving such helpful knowledge to rest of the world!Thank you."
"Pankaj singla","5","this book is soo amazing . this book helps to shape the future ."
"Sameer RN","5","This is a very good book to read. Robin Sharma writes it in a very good way, a book is also divided into many chapters so easy to understand & remember its important things."
"pangloss","3","I read the Monk who sold his ferrari & thus I was inspired to buy this one. I feel there is a lot of repetition and the book didn't offer the excitement or thrill like the former book did."
"Sandip Dhankecha","4","Honest review : This book will surely help you to discover yourself and overcome depression, anxiety, unnecessary concerns and dealing with it... Its a must buy ..  Book size(not lenght) is small  and handy compared to the Monk who sold his ferrari... All in the end.. Its a very fine book k to read and Very helpful to everyone.. Its a good Kickstart for reading."
"Shiva Reddy","4","The size of book is small than i expected.But i can say u 1 thing, that this book has wide variety of topics which is very usefull.Few are them are know topics, even though the way of expressing te different aspects are good."
"Deepika Saharan","5","Its like you dont need a whole day to read it...you can pick this book at any time  .read any chapter which is hardly more than 2 pages and wolllaaaahhh you got a message, a lesson for life , a thing on which you should have given a thought and you might feel like...oh..i had been doing it wrong and now i must improve..just follow one thing in your life each day and u will be a far better person..bt remember its not only to read..its to learn to implement"
"Annanya  gupta","5","if you need motivation? yes! this is the book . one of robin sharma's bestseller.I have read half of the book and it gave me very positive results.The book will change your behaviour and perspective towards life.Its like carrying a mini version of motion in ur bag."
"sachin garg","5","Excellent book. The book identifies some key traits/habits which if inculcated or practised can make life more rewarding and satisfying.  Robin has used very succint essays to bring out the importance of each of these and tips on how to make them a part of our life. Its like getting a quick but invaluable piece of advice from your grandfather."
"Mohd raza","5","I purchased it at 140 + 60 delivery charge
=220
The paper quality seems to be very good
And it fits well in your hands.
This book is about self improvement.
It has about 101 life lessons to learn and to apply in your life.
If you searching for some habits to implement in your day to day life then you can purchase this one, it might be a good option for you."
"Vikram","5","Book is really very nice with good printing and good paper quality.It's short still very nice, and this is what makes it a readable book which will not bore you.If you are an avid reader,you can read it within 8-10 hours."
"Diddi Sathish","1","paper is just like tissue paper. I purchased years back that time very good quality paper and printing is also good. but this time I disappointed a lot. It looks like rough note book. do not buy"
"Amazon Customer","5","One of the best books you can invest on. Has crisp short meaningful chapters that can influence and improve anyone's day to day life. Robin sharma also smartly includes a relevant quote in each chapter and ends almost every chapter in a positive inspiring way.What I liked most was, I could very well relate each and every chapter and realised that all of the mentioned is something I have realised by myself also. But Robin puts it in a very inspiring way. Must read."
"Rahul Kini","5","This book compiles some of the most incredible quotes and thoughts from Robin Sharma and other great thinkers whom he truly regards in high esteem. Investing in the book was perhaps my best decision considering the varied set of dilemmas that I was going through. And yes, I would also like to mention that, unlike other self help books, does not emotionally manipulate you, rather, helps you build your own original perspective  towards life."
"Praveen Kumar","2","You will be disappointed by this book if you bought it after reading the title. this has a number of small chapters but if you are self motivated and working on yoursllf this book will not add any value to your reading. It book just touches on a bunch of topics which you will not find engaging. You can finish the entire book in one or two sitting."
"Upasana","5","This books opens your mind and takes to the right path and focus on yourself and your goals.It is the best self help book I have read in full and enjoy n started following in my life too."
"Adilur Rahman","4","I have completed the book and found it very effective and life changing. The chapters of the book is short. That is the plus point of the book. You can easily finish the book only in a week. If you want to enrich your life this book is highy recommended"
"Maya","4","This books cover all parts of life.Any one interested in learning some amazing things should have it.This gives you a sense ofknowledge about the field concern.Can not say a must buy.You can find the required resources for covering every part of your life via this book.Robin has given lots of resources for our purpose."
"Aparoop","5","This book acts as a compendium of many things that anyone can do, this I believe is the real currency for the book. I do not read too many self help books, however after reading this book I will need very less or that many books as recommended here by Robin.Robin Sharma as an author is distinct because he is honest as a mentor, he shares his experiences- which don't look like advertisements and he is precise. I am tempted to try the Monk who sold his ferrari"
"Shreya Ghosh","5","I totally love this author. I enjoy his podcasts as well. This book helps you get back into an organised lifestyle. However this book is more about application  of the things written than a one time read and then the book gets decorated up on the shelves. Its a slow read and one will enjoy its effects if it keeps applying hem to his/her real life."
"Priyanka saha Roy","5","I purchase bengali version of this book. And as expected amazon delivered it before time. I am really very happy for this. The book in 1 word just awesome. I recommend for everyone pls read this book.its a life changing book. Its not a story or novel type of book,but its really very helpful to your life improvement."
"Amazon Customer","2","This book is not up to that mark which Robin Sharma used to write it's just glimpse in every topic that we know ... The name of the book is nothing to do with the content of the book, Name is just for business to attract the Readers from every corner. If you have already read a self help book from other authors don't prefer to buy this book Surely it will be a waste of money and your valuable time."
"Abhijit","5","I would like to tell you that I loved the book and I have started changing myself into a more responsible person because of what is written in the book. I will even suggest this book to all my peers at work and at home as well.I would also like to thank Robin Sharma for providing such a motivating book and I look forward to do the things that are suggested in this book"
"Mary Jane","5","This is an amazing book by Robin Sharma. I was a bit skeptical about buying this book, as The Monk who sold his Ferrari was a little bit overwhelming for me. There were too many concepts, some contradicting the other and so on, but then, Who will cry when I die is really amazing. This beautiful book comes with 100 little articles and each one is a gem on it's own. They contain a lot of wisdom and practicality and can be practiced in our day to day lives. I enjoyed reading the book."
"Shadab Alam","5","It will inspire you and if you follow the suggestion given by writer it will surely help you to change your life .The one thing which I have start doing after this book is I start making my every day journal which really help me in my every day life ."
