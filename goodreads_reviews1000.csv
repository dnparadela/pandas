0, This is a special book.  It started slow for about the first third then in the middle third it started to get interesting then the last third blew my mind.  This is what I love about good science fiction  it pushes your thinking about where things can go.  It is a  Hugo winner and translated from its original Chinese which made it interesting in just a different way from most things Ive read.  For instance the intermixing of Chinese revolutionary history  how they kept accusing people of being reactionaries etc.  It is a book about science and aliens.  The science described in the book is impressive  its a book grounded in physics and pretty accurate as far as I could tell.  Though when it got to folding protons into  dimensions I think he was just making stuff up  interesting to think about though.  But what would happen if our SETI stations received a message  if we found someone was out there  and the person monitoring and answering the signal on our side was disillusioned?  That part of the book was a bit dark  I would like to think human reaction to discovering alien civilization that is hostile would be more like Enders Game where we would band together.  I did like how the book unveiled the Trisolaran culture through the game.  It was a smart way to build empathy with them and also understand what theyve gone through across so many centuries.  And who know a  body problem was an unsolvable math problem?  But I still dont get who made the game  maybe that will come in the next book.  I loved this quote:  In the long history of scientific progress how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists?  How many neutrons and electrons?  Probably no fewer than a hundred million.  Every collision was probably the end of the civilizations and intelligences in a microcosmos.  In fact even in nature the destruction of universes must be happening at every secondfor example through the decay of neutrons.  Also a highenergy cosmic ray entering the atmosphere may destroy thousands of such miniature universes....,5,True

2, A fun fast paced science fiction thriller.  I read it in  nights and couldnt put it down.  The book is about the quantum theory of many worlds which states that all decisions we make throughout our lives basically create branches and that each possible path through the decision tree can be thought of as a parallel world.  And in this book someone invents a way to switch between these worlds.  This was nicely alluded to/foreshadowed in this quote:  I think about all the choices weve made that created this moment.  Us sitting here together at this beautiful table.  Then I think of all the possible events that could have stopped this moment from ever happening and it all feels I dont know... What?  So fragile.  Now he becomes thoughtful for a moment.  He says finally Its terrifying when you consider that every thought we have every choice we could possibly make branches into a new world.  This book cant be discussed without spoilers.  It is a book about choice and regret.  Ever regret not chasing the girl of your dreams so you can focus on your career?  Well Jason made that choice and then did regret it.  Clearly the author is trying to tell us to optimize for happiness  to be that second rate physics teacher at a community college if it means you can have a happy life.  Im being snarky because while there is certainly something to that you also have to have meaning in your life that comes from within.  I thought the book was a little shallow on this dimension.  In fact all the characters were fairly shallow.  Daniela was the perfect wife.  Ryan the perfect antithesis of Jason.  Amanda the perfect loyal traveling companion etc.  This plus the fact that the book was weak on the science are what led me to take a few stars off  but Id still read it again if I could go back in time  was a very fun and engaging read.  If you want to really minimize regret you have to live your life to avoid it in the first place.  Regret cant be hacked which is kind of the point of the book.  My favorite book about regret is Remains of the Day.  I do really like the visualization of the decision tree though  that is a powerful concept.  Every moment every breath contains a choice.  But life is imperfect.  We make the wrong choices.  So we end up living in a state of perpetual regret and is there anything worse?  I built something that could actually eradicate regret.  Let you find worlds where you made the right choice.  Daniela says Life doesnt work that way.  You live with your choices and learn.  You dont cheat the system.,3,True

4, I really enjoyed this book and there is a lot to recommend it.  It did drag on a little at the end so I knocked off  star  but overall a wow book.  Its the story of a starship sent to Tau Ceti  the nearest star that has Earth analog planets  to colonize it.  The journey there will take generations and the story is told of the rd  th ?  generations which are the ones that reaches Tau Ceti.  It is a story of purpose and how having a purpose affects behavior.  A story of politics and people.  The first cool thing about this book is the richness of its world.  The ship is intricate and large in its design and ambition to shepherd  people for that much time.  It had D printers that can print almost anything you can imagine  even DNA  or more printers  so little goes lacking that cant be recreated.  But the thing that makes this book brilliant is the Ship.  The AI that controls the ship who is narrating the book by the end.  Its observations about humans and our language are just brilliant.  It starts with the astute observation that human language is very imprecise and relies heavily on metaphor and analogy.  It is remarkable once you start to reflect on it how true that is.  To hear the AI reflect on this:  Perhaps there is a provisional solution to this epistemological mess which is to be located in the phrase it is as if.  This phrase is of course precisely the announcement of an analogy.  And on reflection it is admittedly a halting problem but jumping out of it there is something quite suggestive and powerful in this formulation something very specifically human.  Possibly this formulation itself is the deep diagnostic of all human cognitionthe tell as they say meaning the thing that tells the giveaway.  In the infinite black space of ignorance it is as if stands as the basic operation of cognition the mark perhaps of consciousness itself.  Human language: it is as if it made sense.  Basically we are a bunch of pattern matchers trying to match things weve seen before to new things and if they dont match perfectly it doesnt matter because matching helps us bucket and organize the new information.  But this is incredibly fuzzy!  The AI also makes hilarious observations like this:  Indeed it has to be said that the percentage of old human sayings and proverbs that are actually true is very far from  percent.  Seems it may be less important that it be true than that it rhyme or show alliteration or the like.  What goes around comes around: really?  What does this mean?  Or this as it analyzes chatter from Earth: It was a whiny culture we were finding.  Listening to the AI try to reason is also very interesting to my programmers mind.  I especially loved its discussion of the meaning of life  it really nails it.  If a program or a person has no objective it has no purpose no meaning no organizing principle and its existence will be in trouble.  But if you have that meaning to organize your thoughts  actions  or your subroutines  than you have a purpose.  Meaning is the hard problem indeed.  We had a project on this trip back to the solar system and that project was a labor of love.  It absorbed all our operations entirely.  It gave a meaning to our existence.  And this is a very great gift this in the end is what we think love gives which is to say meaning.  Because there is no very obvious meaning to be found in the universe as far as we can tell.  But a consciousness that cannot discern a meaning in existence is in trouble very deep trouble for at that point there is no organizing principle no end to the halting problems no reason to live no love to be found.  No: meaning is the hard problem.  My review focuses a lot on the AI but thats not the main thrust of the book.  The war between stayers and leavers the political tensions the slinghot maneuvers to get back  all make the book worth reading.  And as a surfer I love how it ends with Freya finding meaning in surfing waves.,4,True
5, A beautiful story.  It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind  you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across.  I generally love WWII books and movies but wasnt sure if Id like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator  but he brings a lot of life to them.  That said the novel drifts around a lot and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts.  I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book.  One was the diamond and if it was really cursed based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?.  Another is that K Leagues is an awesome book.  But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown and how people deal with it.  MarieLaure was blind and couldnt tell what was happening around her  yet she was the bravest one.  Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner which drove him to join the army and learn about radios.  And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldnt see so he didnt leave his house and he created a radio transmitter.  So the moral of the story is... dont be paralyzed by your fears.  This she realizes is the basis of his fear all fear.  That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.,4,False

8, Another hard to put down nonfiction book from Erik Larson.  I really enjoyed this book  mostly to learn more about submarine warfare in WWI but also to learn about the history of the time.  How America entered the war the importance of shipping to England the ruthlessness and autonomy of German uboat commanders.  Larson also did a great job of layering in interesting historical info though he overdid it too a little bit.  One of the dramas of the story of the Lusitania that Larson focuses on is if the British wanted the Lusitania to be sunk to help draw America into the war.  His conclusion seems to be that was the case though there isnt conclusive evidence.  Before the Lusitania sank very few Americans had died in the war and there were hundreds of Americans on the boat when it sank which definitely helped change Americas attitude.  And even then it took  years after it sank for Americas troops to arrive.  the most likely explanation is that there was indeed a plot however imperfect to endanger the Lusitania in order to involve the United States in the war.  Some of my favorite details from the book were simply about what it took to navigate a uboat in WW.  For instance:  In this day before sonar a submarine traveled utterly blind trusting entirely in the accuracy of sea charts.  One great fear of all Uboat men was that a halfsunk derelict or an uncharted rock might lie in their path.  Which is crazy!  Plus the torpedoes weigh  thousand pounds each so a boat could only carry  and their failure rate was something like .  Also they had limited fuel and operated only on batteries when submerged so they could only stay underwater for limited amounts of time.  Given all this trying to operate a uboat to sink other boats is a pretty dangerous sounding game of chess.  But they certainly had an effect on the war  at one point Britain estimated it would have to surrender in  months if it didnt get more supplies.  There were a lot of interesting details from the era that Larson wove in that was interesting as well.  Stuff like the fact that Ouija boards were commonplace in American households straw hat day.  My main critique is that it had a few too many irrelevant details  about various passengers or what happened the day the boat left dock  and stuff like that  felt a bit padded in that respect.  But overall a great read.,4,False
9, I love Stephenson  and this was another hit  absolutely loved it.  The great thing about a good Stephenson book is it makes you think about the future in new ways and this book was no exception.  It was really two books and I certainly didnt see the second one coming.  It starts out in modern times and then someone blows up the moon.  We dont have time to find out who as within a few years the fragments of the moon cause the worst asteriod shower earth has ever seen and wipe out all life in earth.  We have time to send  people up into space  and this is their story.  The use of robots throughout the books was fascinating to me.  Stephenson has clearly looked  years into our future and correctly predicted how it will go.  From robot workers in space nanobots nanorobot weapons and more  we get a vivid portrayal of how robots might be a part of our future lives.  I thought the focus on use of whip technology in space was interesting.  And of course the whole notion of Cradle was just cool  though not sure about its feasibility.,5,False
10, A beautiful story.  Neil Gaiman is truly a unique storyteller.  I did a combo of reading and listening to this story and Neil is great at reading as well.  I got interested in this book after seeing the movie which I really enjoyed.  The book is similar  maybe a bit more poetic  but I think the plot in the movie is a bit improved not much but a bit.  I imagine this book came about because Neil read the below poem that he includes in the beginning and then he invented a plot around it.  The result is the book reads like a epic poem  its creative magical and really just right.  Go and catch a falling star  Get with child a mandrake root  Tell me where all past years are  Or who cleft the devils foot  Teach me to hear mermaids singing  Or to keep off envys stinging  And find  What wind  Serves to advance an honest mind.  If thou best born to strange sights  Things invisible to see  Ride ten thousand days and nights  Till age snow white hairs on thee  Thou when thou returnst wilt tell me  All strange wonders that befell thee  And swear  No where  Lives a woman true and fair.  If thou findst one let me know  Such a pilgrimage were sweet  Yet do not I would not go  Though at next door we might meet  Though she were true when you met her  And last till you write your letter  Yet she  Will be  False ere I come to two or three.  And here is my new favorite quote: Have been unavoidably detained by the world.  Expect us when you see us.,5,False
11, I couldnt put this book down.  It was well written  even elegant in a way as well as though provoking.  I love post apocalyptic books as they are great canvass for humanity and what matters.  In Station Eleven an Ebolaesque virus the Georgia Flu knocks out over  of the worlds population.  This story is told half right before the collapse and half afterwards and has several threads that tie together nicely.  Reading how civilization and infrastructure all die after the collapse is fascinating.  One by one cable tv the internet water and power all eventually stop working.  Nobody is alive to maintain them  or who even knows how.  Other infrastructure like gasoline to power cars and airplanes groceries guns and even clothing all become rarer and rarer commodities.  Really makes you realize how much we are standing on the shoulder of hundreds of years of progress and knowledge and how far into the middle ages we could easily fall.  We really know nothing individually  our civilization is based upon the collective knowledge of billions.  If there is a motto of the book its probably this quote: Because survival is insufficient.  Humanity craves for more than survival  we crave for something more out of life.  The story follows a caravan of actors and musicians who travel from town to town to play Shakespeare and bring some art and a shared experience.  Interesting that of all the artists from the past  years Shakespeare is the one that survives and still resonates.  All three caravans of the Traveling Symphony are labeled as such THE TRAVELING SYMPHONY lettered in white on both sides but the lead caravan carries an additional line of text: Because survival is insufficient.  Survival might be insufficient shed told Dieter in latenight arguments but on the other hand so was Shakespeare.  The storyline precollapse that follows Arthur and his three wives is interesting.  I wont say much about it other than Arthur his wives and the paparazziturnedjounalistturnedparamedicturneddoctor Jeevan seem to all be searching for meaning in their lives.  And ironically Jeevan seems to find the most becoming a doctor after the collapse.  Also Im glad Im not a Hollywood celebrity.  The conversation between Arthur and Jeevan where Arthur just wants to talk about anything but himself stuck with me  sometimes we are all sick of talking about ourselves.  Regardless of what you think about this book one thing is for sure  after you put it down and walk around the world you are full of a newfound appreciation and gratitude for everything.  Hopefully that appreciation and gratitude will stick around a little  though I know it will fade as months and years go by.  ps.  This is cool:,5,False
12, What a fun series.  I loved Wool and Dust and Shift both gave us the backstory to explain the world and how it ended up.  I think the first book was by far the best but this gave us a nice conclusion.  It was the conclusion we wanted to see  the people finally get outside!  My problem with this book is there were lots of holes.  A lot of the other reviews have pointed this out too and Im not sure if the fact I know it was selfpublished is biasing me to say it could have used more editing but feels that way a little.  But the writing was great.  There were lots of things that werent cleared up or never really fully made sense.  The major one is why Thurman really felt the need to destroy the whole world  feels like there could have been a lot more to that.  It also wasnt clear how he really accomplished that  was it all nuclear or was it nano?  If nuclear wouldnt the world really be a wasteland?  Whatever happened to silo  and other silos that went dark?  I was kind of expecting that they had already broken outside and would have been waiting there.  Or perhaps they already went to the sea and Hugh will tell us their story later.  What happens to the other silos after silo one is destroyed?  Didnt it power their server rooms and probably provide other stuff including guidance to the silo heads?  Will they make the  years on their own?  The mystery of silo  and why the dead bodies at the top didnt rot was never really explained.  Im guessing they were kept whole by healing nanos but it felt like there was more to that story.  I didnt understand why Anna didnt come back to life.  If Thurman could do so after being killed by Donald why not her?  All the love stories Juliet and Kyle Donald and Anna etc ended up sadly  I wanted one happy one.  If anything I think this book is about hope and resiliency.  Jules and Donald and even Solo werent perfect and suffered through a lot but the only thing that kept them going was hope of a better life and determination to keep themselves alive.  That determination defined them and was what we admired about them.  The hope was what gave them their drive.  Hope is a powerful and necessary part of human psychology.,4,True

14, A classic dystopian novel published in  but still very relevant  and even trending in  due to the political climate.  I liked how it unfolded  we learn about the state of the world and what has happened to it very piecemeal throughout the book and I think if Atwood had just described it all up front it wouldnt have been nearly as compelling.  This book seems to be a kind of warning.  It describes a future state that is chilling and depressing and yet to the point chillingly possible.  It describes a society that has  for reasons we never quite learn but might have to do with radiation or sterilization?  remade itself from one where everyone has basic freedom and choice to one that is the opposite of that.  Pleasure poverty and other evils are eliminated in this system.  And most chillingly women have almost no rights.  The books main character is a hand maiden whos only role is to bear children from the person who seems to have purchased/acquired her for that purpose.  She doesnt even have a proper name anymore  she is called Offred because she is the property of Fred.  We were a society dying said Aunt Lydia of too much choice.  A lot of the book explores themes like the above  what it would be like to take away basic freedoms choices and also ability to have relationships with others.  Chilling and depressing because so much of what we value in modern society is our freedom.  And yet we do know that too much choice does paralyze and many people want leaders and situations that simplify the decisions they have to make.  This might sound like a balance but its not because our ability to make choice especially bad choices is actually crucial to our development.  Better never means better for everyone he says.  It always means worse for some.  This was an insightful sentence because it implied the commander thought they were making society better not worse overall.  And yet clearly for everyone in the book  including the commander  it doesnt sound better.  Did they just miss the mark?  Was it a big experiment gone wrong?  Regardless in todays world this sentence is perhaps most applicable:  We lived as usual by ignoring.  Ignoring isnt the same as ignorance you have to work at it.  Nothing changes instantaneously: in a gradually heating bathtub youd be boiled to death before you knew it.,4,False
15, Mark Watney is a steelyeyed missile man.  A mans man.  A badass mechanical engineer botanist astronaut who is stranded on Mars during a Nasa mission gone wrong and left to fend for himself.  I listened to this on audio on a roadtrip and it flew by  what a fun story.  Not surprised at all its being made into a movie directed by Ridley Scott starring Matt Damon.  Also pretty amazing is that it was selfpublished.  There were two great things about this book: the humor and the science.  The science appealed to the mechanical engineer in me  Watney is a bit like McGyver except he knows a lot more about chemistry and botany.  I didnt doublecheck all the science but loved the descriptions of all the math: calorie calculations creating water etc.  Just fun stuff.  But the humor was top notch.  Weir does a great job portraying a stranded man trying to remain upbeat by talking to himself in log entries.  And the excellent audio narrator only made it better.  I started the day with some nothin tea.  Nothin tea is easy to make.  First get some hot water then add nothin.  Yes of course duct tape works in a nearvacuum.  Duct tape works anywhere.  Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.  Live Another Sol would be an awesome name for a James Bond movie.  In the end a well told story of survival against the odds.  And one of belief  I liked the CNN Mark Watney watch  you could totally imagine how into this story the media would get.  We humans love a good surviving against the odds story.,5,False
16, An amazing and unique creation: JJ Abrams and Doug Dorst created what reads like a classic work of fiction  something you can easily imagine having read in English class  and then wrote a intriguing side story in the margins.  A grad student Eric has left his annotated copy of SOT Ship of Theseus in the library and an undergrad Jen finds it and replies to his annotations.  This leads to them making exciting discoveries about the book and also falling in love.  The first thing is this book is just beautifully printed.  It looks and feels like a classic book to the point where people would ask me why Im reading such an old book.  The marginalia feels real and I can only imagine how hard that was to print.  This is one that will be cool to keep on the shelves.  Only complaint is the inserts are a cool idea but they fall out all the time and at this point I have no idea which pages they were supposed to be on.  The most interesting thing about this book to me is that its a blueprint for how people discuss books.  Sometimes they discuss the content of the book.  Other times they use the content as a jumping off point to have a personal discussion.  The nature of this book shows both almost split /.  A key difference with this book  and the genius of it  is that most of us have to rely on memory to start a conversation with someone about a particular event or passage in the book.  Here our characters can literally underline a phrase like relationships and then talk about what is happening in their relationship at the moment.  One thing I didnt realize until later in the book is that the ship of Theseus is a real thing  its an ancient Greek philosophical question  if you replace all the parts of something is it still the same object?  This inspires the ship that S is captured on which sails through the mists of time always getting fixed when needed.  Its a ship that cant die.  Or a series of ships :  I found the story of Jen  Eric a lot more compelling than the SOT story.  They were real characters that you could relate to.  SOT felt like books you read in english class  a bit obtuse  and I still dont understand it all.  But dont get me wrong  its a pretty cool story.  I particularly enjoyed the themes  like how it all begins and ends with water and also how it was a lot about Strakas regret to fulfill his mission instead of living his life with his true love.  Kind of like how S was on a mission but didnt really know why  he just found himself caught up in it.,4,False
17, I tore through The Pillars of the Earth and couldnt wait to pick this up.  Set in Kingsbridge but a few centuries later the story has a lot of similar elements: a cathedral that needs repair a brilliant young builder Merthin a love story a priorship up for grabs and of course political manuevering backstabbing and evil church officials.  Also like the first one the characters were developed well the book was hard to put down and yet it wasnt a deep book just a fun one.  Thank goodness I finished  it was causing me to lose sleep.  I did enjoy learning about the plague and medieval ideas on health and medicine.  Amazing that the plague wiped about a third of the human population and how little they knew about it.  Was frustrated by the lack of the Monks openness to learn new things and how little they trusted women.  For instance they believed in bleeding as a solution to everything when it actually is harmful in most cases.  Also was interesting that there was no such thing as a doctor  instead nuns/monks/etc served that role.,5,False
18, The Circle is a new bay area company but is really GoogleFacebook.  It dominates search and social media has a huge sprawling campus in the south bay and is full of intelligent ambitious young employees.  This story is I think a take on where the connected nature of the internet might be taking us.  Its essentially a discussion about privacy vs openness and I think a serious esque warning about being too open.  I thought a lot of the book was kind of shallow and unrealistic.  The characters werent very well developed.  And I cant imagine an HR department that would get on your case for not using social media or attending a brunch you were invited too  it was just too extreme to believe.  But I suppose that was on purpose as the author was just making a point.  I appreciated the point see below but didnt love the story.  Mark Zuckerberg has been fairly public on saying that he believes a more open society is a better one.  The notion is exactly the one Mae learns with the kayak incident  if your whole life is open to your friends and family its very hard to do anything dishonest or that you might regret.  The premise of the Circle  that privacy and secrecy are bad  is taking this idea to an extreme that I doubt Zuckerberg or anyone else who runs a social network has ever contemplated: complete openness.  Or as its motto says:  All That Happens Must Be Known.  It is easy to imagine us eventually living in a world like the Circle contemplates.  With public video cameras everywhere that document everything we do and tons more data photos videos texts available to search engines to scan through.  Already there are startups like Dropcam that enable public video feeds that are archived.  There are atm and building and traffic cameras everywhere that the police already use.  I heard of another startup that puts a video camera on you and it takes photos of everything all day and creates a montage of your day that is searchable/sortable for you.  In many ways we should already start acting like everything we do at least outside of our homes is being recorded on camera.  I think the central question the book poses is the one Bailey contemplates with Mae: is there such a thing as a good secret?  Should we have privacy at all?  Or would the world at large be better off if all secrets are known?  I think we know where Mr Eggers stands on the subject as the book seemed to be written in a dystopian mocking kind of way.  But it is in an interesting thought experiment as many secrets would ultimately be better overall not necessarily for the disclosing party but for the overall situation if they were known.  For example you dont want to tell your friend that you know their significant other is cheating on them b/c you arent supposed to know but ultimately it would be better for them to know.  Can you think of a secret you know that should be a secret?  But of course there are lots of secrets that should stay secrets.  Ignorance often truly is bliss and people often just need to be weird and express themselves in ways that not everyone would appreciate if it were open.  We are private beings and yet our dignity and sense of selfworth largely stems from how others perceive us.  I think this book is a thoughtprovoking story that shows us how our society is changing.,4,False
19, My wife suggested I read this book and I resisted for a while as my impression of it somehow was not for me  but I was wrong!  Im glad she finally convinced me because it was fun and I couldnt put it down after I got  in.  Bernadette moved to Seattle from LA abandons her career as an architect to have kids hates Seattle and basically loses it over the course of the book.  The book was fun and written a light humorous tone  from making fun of Seattle and Microsoft the obsession of parents and how serious they take themselves I loved how she called the other parents gnats to how she hires a virtual assistant in India.  But the most fun part of the book is just how wacky Bernadette is.  You really do have to make life fun  it wont do it for you.  Thats right she told the girls.  You are bored.  And Im going to let you in on a little secret about life.  You think its boring now?  Well it only gets more boring.  The sooner you learn its on you to make life interesting the better off youll be.,5,False
20, A fun fast paced book that sucks you in right away and doesnt let go.  The remnants of humanity live in a  story silo below the earth and cant leave as the outside is now toxic.  This is a bit of an odd thing to have happened but it gives us a nice palette to think about things.  Everything is rationed including how many children you can have.  People selfidentify by their profession and where in the silo they live: farmers and mechanics in the lowers IT in the mids and professional class in the uppers.  The working class wear color coded uniforms to easily distinguish them.  The book was a lot about control.  How to control a contained civilization and give them hope eg a live feed of the outside and yet keep them in harmony and doing their functions.  Strange mechanisms of control were built all over the silo: communication was oddly limited given the IT resources they have  many messages had to be delivered by courier as emails cost valuable money to send.  Most strange of all  there is no elevator which forces anyone wanting to travel the length of the silo to spend  days on the journey.  The cleaning ritual was a strange bit of culture.  Upon reflection I can see why it was necessary.  If people never go outside uncertainty of it still being bad would creep in and people would need to try it.  As perhaps happened in Silo .  I really liked the unraveling of Bernard and how he went from repulsive/annoying to understandable once you understood his role and responsibility.  His role is to eliminate any doubt in the delicate balance of the silo.  Opening the book up with the doubt of Holston was brilliant as it sucked you in immediately.  I liked Juliet too  she was the right combo of being determined to do right and having brains and grit.,4,True
21, A hilarious romp through the known and unknown universe that exposes how ridiculous much of US copyright law is.  Written by the founder of Rhapsody who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it.  What I didnt expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book  and this book is not bad.  It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide which nothing can approach but its not bad.  My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didnt work for me.  The basic premise of the book is brilliant that aliens have been listening to  and thus pirating  our music since  without our knowledge.  Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined   this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity.  Its pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed.  I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate.  Overall a fun enjoyable read.,4,False
22, This book has a great premise and is full of some beautifully written prose.  Its about a hacker during the Arab Spring helping people get around the firewalls that the State erected to control its population.  Alif falls in love finds an ancient book gets into trouble with State enlists the help of an unseen magical world full of creatures call Jinn and combats evil.  The story flowed well and was a fast fun read.  I would have given it a higher rating but Im a computer programmer and for a book that is about hacking the descriptions of Alif coding felt like I was watching one of those movies where they used a bunch of madeup visuals that have nothing to do with hacking.  The prose around the hacking was so oddly descriptive you didnt know what to make of it.  For instance when Alif is hacking into States intranet it is described as:  The Hand roused.  It lumbered to its feet reeking of ionized air and dry metallic bones revealing a level of functionality Alif had not detected.  He reeled backward recalibrating.  Breaching the confines of the State intranet the Hand began to attack the base of Alifs tower slicing away layers of code through a mirroring protocol of a kind Alif had never seen before.  I didnt know a computer program could reek of ionized air  and cant conceive of how a mirroring protocol if there is such a thing could ever be used to slice away layers of code.  I wanted so hard for the bit about quantum computing and encoding the ancient story into code to make sense.  But it just didnt.  And that was the heart of the story  that the ancient text contained an allpowerful computer algorithm.  I also had trouble buying the Alif  Dina relationship  the characters just felt shallow to me.,3,True
23, A fun dark slightly comical western about two killers Charlie and Eli Sisters on their way to California for the gold rush.  Going into the mind of a killer is a strange experience  Im not sure I totally enjoyed it.  But what I did really enjoy was the authors writing it was clean fun and even poetic  which made this book a quick enjoyable read.  I loved all the introspective oneliners that Eli kept throwing out.  For instance:  but I could not sleep without proper covering and spent the rest of the night rewriting lost arguments from my past altering history so that I emerged victorious.  I thought When a man is properly drunk it is as though he is an a room by himselfthere is a physical impenetrable separation between him and his fellows.  Here is another miserable mental image I will have to catalog and make room for.  It is true I thought.  I am living a life.  The effects of her words stung me and after she stole away I stood a long while before her looking glass studying my profile the line I cut in this world of men and ladies.  I struggled however to find the point of this novel.  What lesson was I meant to take away?  What did we learn from Charlie and Elis adventure?  I suppose if anything the theme of the book was transformation.  We witnessed Warm Morris and Eli have the courage to transform themselves and change their lives.  In other words  its easy to let life dictate your path.  Elis story of how Charlie sucked him into a life of crime was fascinating.  Warm had a similar story of how he became a thief.  We didnt learn about Morriss past but we did see the difficulty of his decision to leave the Commodores employment.  It takes guts to transform oneself  especially for the better.,3,True
24, Wow.  Amazing story and well told  kept me up late at night!  Louie Zamperini truly went through hell and came back  and its inspiring to read a story of such willpower and determination.  It was also interesting to me to learn more about Japan and their role in the war.  One big takeaway was just how cheap human life is in war.  I think there was some stat about how / of the US airmen that died did so from accidents  that is simply staggering.  I love WWII stories but most of the ones Ive seen and read have focused on Germany so I really didnt know much about how Japan had treated their POWs.  It was pretty eye opening to read the stats about how they pretty much massacred hundreds of thousands of POWs.  And of couse as the story details they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POWs as slaves.  One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water food and oxygen.  This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well  if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away.  I loved all the stories of POWs being defiant stealing food supplies playing jokes etc.  The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity and I think thats what makes them so compelling because while we havent all been POWs we can relate to that basic need.,5,False
25, A hilarious and book from Tina Fey  definitely worth listening to over audio as she reads it herself.  She makes fun of herself a lot adds lots of light humor and of course shares TMI.  The most interesting bit was hearing the behind the scenes of Saturday Night Live and how she was a joke writer there for  years before they gave her a role on the show which was only doing the news.  Her breakout occurred after she had already left for  Rock when she did the Sarah Palin impersonation.  Tina is clearly an example of someone who has worked long and hard to get where she is.,4,False
26,  spoiler alert   Loved it.  The epic saga continues.  The poor Starks are torn apart but yet are surprisingly resilient.  In fact pretty much every major character is in danger of dying and some even do.  Its a bit tough to read as you really wanted The King In The North to succeed.  And Dany is fast becoming an interesting part of the plot that has yet to intermix with the rest of the characters.  Ill be starting the next one soon.  These books are like crack.,5,False
27, This sounds awesome.,5,False
28, Great story of the US Ambassador to Germany and his experience during the buildup of ww from   .  Nothing new or exciting really revealed and Im sure there are many other accounts of the buildup to ww out there but this one told it from the perspective of mostly the Ambassador Dodd and his daughter Martha.  The story was engaging and wellwritten and thus interesting.  I think the ending fell pretty flat  I was hoping for more.  Reading about the Nazis one is of course always appalled at how they got to be in power and commit such atrocities and this book did provide some clues.  Hitler seemed primarily willing to tell people what they needed and wanted to hear even if it wasnt the truth  and he was a great storyteller.  He also used fear as a primary weapon as there were many in Germany not behind him  but they were too afraid to make a stand or speak up.  I suppose the climax of the book was the Night of the Long Knives where Hitler arrested and executed all of his major opponents clearing the way for his absolute grip on the nation.  He ruthlessly murdered an estimated  to several hundred people the count was never really known and played it off as putting down a rebellion which much of the world bought for many years.  I think one of the more interesting pieces of the book was watching Dodd and Martha go from thinking the Nazis were good for Germany to realizing how terrible they were and hoping for them to be overthrown.  It was a slow gradual process and one that Im sure was not immediately obvious to anyone.  In the end I think the book is aptly named.,4,False
29,  spoiler alert   An interesting book in terms of its structure:  distinct stories that cascade into each other in subtle ways then wind back out.  This way of doing the structure was unique and certainly very cool to see the subtle way they were tied together.  But in the end it was kind of gimmick and probably not necessary.  I generally dont try to summarize novels in my reviews but in this case there was so much going on that the exercise was helpful.  Story : The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing.  Later revealed to be a journal in other stories.  A story about a rather weakwilled protagonist who is constantly taken advantage of by others the ships captain Dr Goose.  Interesting side story about the peaceful native Moriori tribe and how they were taken advantage of.  Story : Robert Frobisher.  Perhaps my favorite story  about a penniless young musician who as a lastditch attempt apprentices himself to an old master musician Vyvyan Ayrs.  The story is told through letters to a friend Sixsmith who appears in the next story.  The story is about how Frobisher the apprentice goes from being overjoyed to have a job to being resentful that the master is using him and stealing his stuff.  Robert sleeps with VAs wife the whole story but ends up falling in love with the daughter in a cruel twist of fate.  Story : Luisa Rey.  Modern age story about a young journalist hot on the heels of a big scandal involving an energy company.  Sixsmith is an engineer who leaks the story to her and also has the letters from story .  Classic detectiveesque story with lots of people willing to kill to protect their secrets and power.  Story : Timothy Cavendish.  Modern age story about a book editor who gets a smash hit then the authors mafiaesque family gets on his case and hes on the run.  He lands in a oldpersons home/prison.  This story is kind of a nightmare and is revealed to be a movie in the next story.  Story : Somni .  One of favorites for how different it was.  Set in the far future in an asian country humans have genetically created clones that serve as slaves.  This lower class is regarded as unintelligent and controlled with drugs  but our protagonist Somni breaks through and becomes selfconscious.  The scary thing is I can easily see this happening!  Told as recollections in an interview.  Story : Slooshas Crossin.  Story of Zachry and Meronym in post apocalyptic Hawaii.  Somni is now their deity.  Story of the Valleysmen people and their struggle for freedom against neighboring tribes.  All six stories were very graphic and real and had extremely good character development.  Mitchel could with a single sentence describe someone that you understood in a way I cant describe here.  I wish the stories had more themes in common so I could say what I learned from this book.  Though I suppose if I had to put my finger on it the major theme was freedom and slavery.  Ewing was under the control of Dr Goose and the ship captain Frobisher became an unwilling servant to Arys Luisa Rey needed to find the truth in order to free herself from the corporate villians Frobisher was a prisoner bent on escape in a nursing home Somni was literally a slave in her society and focused on freedom and Zachrys people were captured and enslaved.  All the stories touched on various ways people can enslave and control other people for various reasons.  I suppose the point is human beings are all greedy and will try to control other human beings but if we are strong we can survive and find a way to free ourselves.  Sounds good anyways so Ill stick with that  but am interested to hear what other people thought.,4,False
30, I havent stayed up until am to finish a book in a while  it felt good.  This was a great murdermystery thriller and more interesting as its set in Sweden and deals with journalists corporations and hackers.  Good stuff!,5,False
31, I cracked and finally picked this up.  Very enjoyable quick read  couldnt put it down  it was like crack.  Im a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about.  It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other?  I was expecting it because Ive seen Battle Royale but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state.  I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all.  The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way but by definition of course any partnership will be broken and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal.  Each character approached the game in their own way.  Some banded together in larger coalitions some were loners initially and banded together later.  And some were just loners like Foxface.  A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own?  Selfdependence is highly valued  and of course our hero was strong there.  All in all a fun read but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.,5,False
32,  spoiler alert   Critics aside Dan Brown can sure write a thriller.  I was stuck in an airport with no book and picked this up and was done with it in  days.  The first half of the book was really gripping and promised big things.  We were going to learn about the secrets of the Masons and about the ancient wisdom that has been lost through the ages.  Sounds cool  I wanted to learn more about the ancient wisdom.  But the end of the book just fell really flat.  The villian was predictable and we learned nothing about this ancient wisdom.  I also have to say that I almost fell out of bed laughing with Dan Brown plugged Twitter at the end of the book.  To be fair hes right  people are excited about Twitter because it along with many other websites is helping cause a shift in our society.  But I cant help wondering if  years from now when Twitter is MySpace people will read that and think wtf?,3,False
33, A great finish to the DArtagnan series  definitely enjoyed it.  Ending wasnt what I wanted though you could tell he was just trying to permanently end the series.  It could easily be having seen the movie made me want more drama.,3,False
34,  spoiler alert   I equally loved book  and am definitely hooked.  I did feel it took a little while for them to get to sea but I guess we cant bring in a love interest if we arent on the land!  My favorite thing by far was the Lively and the descriptions of how fast she is and how much care the crew took keeping her a crack ship.  Pride in what you do can be a great motivator.  I also loved how Jack made them work the guns against all the batteries for practice.,5,False
35, I read a bunch of Bond books in High School and hadnt read one since so I really enjoyed this one.  As I remember a few of them being it was very different from the movie.  Though the main players  Scaramanga Goodnight and Felix Leiter  were all still there  but there was no midget!  Bond books are simple yet somehow still very compelling.  The way Flemming wrote Bond seems much more human and susceptible yet determined and focused him  in the movies he seems more superhuman.  I think Daniel Craigs movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit.  In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.,5,False
36, As an engineer I couldnt help but love this book.  Its full of logic games!  The  rules of robotics are a very rich medium for lots of fun puzzles and I very much enjoyed reading them.  I think the book originally came out in serial form as it was broken down into short stories or capers.  Kind of reminded me of Sherlock Holmes  another favorite of mine.  Examining robots also gave a canvas for defining what it is to be human.  I loved the robot religion story.  Robots with a superiority complexes  but thank goodness for that first law or it would be a Terminatorstyle story.  According to Asimovs predictions in  the robot revolution should be in full swing.  But I dont see a lot of robots around.  Anyone have a good prediction on where we are with robots?  When will we have pet robots and robot laborers?,5,False
37, One of the most enjoyable stories Ive read in some time.  Captain Jack Aubrey was a fascinating character.  You just wanted him to succeed  to capture the Spanish vessel to gain the respect of his men to gain the respect of the Admiral.  The book is set during the Napoleonic Wars and it was interesting to see all the Kings ships were nothing but glorified pirates capturing all vessels they could on the open seas.  The book also strongly reminded me of my sailing lessons from last summer  I still had to look a lot of words up but I remembered ones like leeward and abeam.  Makes me want to go sailing!,5,False
38, Loved every minute.  So sad there isnt another!  I thought JK really made Harry an even stronger archetypal hero  almost in a Paul MaudDib from Dune kind of way.  Hes fighting the ultimate evil hes brave and takes risks and believes in himself and doesnt give up despite many hardships.  I think JK really did a phenomenal job as I bet every kid who reads this will have a little bit of hero/Gryffindor in them.  The epilogue was lame though.  I would have rather seen a  months later epilogue than a  years later one.,5,False
39, A great book and worth the read but like many Gladwellian books it can be summed up easily.  The basic point is that there is no such thing as a true outlier.  Success it seems is due primarily to hard work and circumstance  brains play little part.  Gladwell went through several fascinating examples proving his thesis  people such as Bill Gates Joe Flom at Skadden Oppenheimer some failed genius named Chris Langan.  All of them had two things in common: they spent over  hours doing what they did and they had fortunate circumstances that let them get ahead of everyone else.  Bill Gates was smart but so were lots of other geeks.  He had the advantage of being  when the computing age came about and being possibly the only  year old in the country with access to a computer  and he spent all his time on it.  By the time he hit college he had well over  hours of computer time and was arguably one of the foremost experts in the country.  One of my favorite bits was the music study on page  that compared musicians and couldnt find any naturals  the skill of each musician at comparable amounts of practice was equal.  Its kind of validating to hear this as many of us have this feeling that there are naturally smarter people out there than us.  But apparently this isnt true  and I think my personal experience agrees with this.  The harder you work the better you can do.  One other big takeaway was how circumstance can change things.  The hockey league study and elementary school studies were fascinating and relevant.  Basically kids that are in the older third of their class or hockey league have a natural advantage when theyre really little.  They are the kids who make allstar and get extra coaching and because of that they practice more and thus do become better by the time they are older.  I was held back in preschool so I was one of the oldest in my class and I definitely think it helped me.  Hmmm now can I plan my kids to be born to be the oldest?,4,False
40, I read this after hearing from a few people that it was among their alltime favorites.  I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits originally written as a tale by a father to his children  but Im glad I wasnt.  I found the folk tales about Elahrairah to be very impressive.  The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history.  But I think this book was worth reading as its really a story about survival leadership and human nature.  Oh and Fiver rocks.  And BigWig is the man.,5,False
41, This should be . stars.  I really enjoyed it but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere.  That being said it was very imaginative and entertaining.  Hrun the Barbarian was one of my favorites as was anything the Luggage did.,3,False
42,  spoiler alert   Just finished this and have to say I really enjoyed it.  I was kind of worried the plot wasnt going anywhere for much of it but the writing was really good and drew me in.  For much of the book I thought the main character Richard was too weak of a character for me to like much but I liked how he grew in confidence towards the end.  I think anytime one undertakes an adventure or a journey like that you grow so much.  You have to get out there and fail a few times to have the confidence to know how to succeed!  I also have to say I loved Mister Croup and Mister Vandemar.  Their dialogue and interaction was hilarious.  It really reminded me of Mister Wint and Mister Kidd from James Bonds  Diamonds are Forever.,4,False
43, Seven amazing stories.  Each one you think cant possibly top the last and then it does.  We never really get to understand what is up with the Time Tombs  guess I have to keep reading.  But the strength of each of these stories is worth it.  One of the best books Ive read in a while.,5,False
44, Highly recommended if you are curious about Manicdepressive disease.  A fascinating and even very well written insight from a woman who is both a Psychiatrist who treats it and suffers from it.  She was very brave and very poetic in writing this book.,4,False
45, Loved this book.,5,False
46,  spoiler alert   I absolutely loved the first book but didnt think the series finished as strong as I would have liked.  Too many plot holes and things that didnt make sense.  Maybe it was because its supposed to be a childrens book but I didnt like things like how the harpies were so easily convince to change sides how Gods  is easily tricked by a little flirting how Lyra  Will can suddenly easily lose their Daemons and how two kids making love can save the universe.  On the other hand the book did make you think and I suppose religious ideas are probably best challenged in a childrens book : I did like the Dantes Infernoesque description of the world of the dead and Pullmans description of angels and their roles was brilliant.  Also the descriptions of how things evolved differently in different worlds was very interesting  particularly the Mulefas world and the descriptions of the Gallivespians.  Im usually not a tragedy fan but I did think Lyra  Will being separated at the end was a romantic and appropriate ending.,4,False
47, Loved every second and didnt want it to end so I had to find a book store and buy the next two!  Its a Harry Potter reading level and similar type fantasy story but sometimes thats what you need on a long flight to NYC for the holidays!  I think as a child we all daydreamed about alternate worlds so I love how thats the basis for the book.  Thinking about all the permutations of how things could turn out differently is kinda fun : I think if I had a Daemon I would hope shed settle on being a lynx.,5,False

50, Im not sure if I love Khaleds characters see my review of The Kite Runner but the man can tell a story.  I think all Americans need to read this book as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through.  Particularly interesting as the book spans  years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time.  From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army there have been no shortage of invaders and wars and victims.  Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way.  So a little sad but I liked it.  I think the thing I liked most was that Ive read so few books about that area of the world and now I feel like Ive gotten to know it just a tiny bit.,5,False
51, A quick read and probably better than  The Da Vinci Code.,4,False
52, I really enjoyed this book.  The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea  and a rich canvas.  Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults  and our advantages.  I think my favorite part of this book is the word grok.  I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word  but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is to be enlightened about something.  If you grok God you have reached enlightenment.  If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it.  If you grok another person you love them.  If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming  that and youre also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like grok : I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasnt forgiven me since I had to explain that it was a Martian word!  One thing that I grokked yes Im going to keep using it dammit after finishing this book is that it is kind of a s manifesto for free love.  I wasnt alive in the s but given everything I know about the s from movies books etc it seemed that my grokking was right.,5,False
53, Great book.  A scifi classic.  The fact that Gibson wrote this in  is very impressive as he makes many predictions that seem like they are coming true was that a prediction?,4,False

55, Great book about Galileo from the perspective of his daughter.,5,False
56, Despite having a name that sounds like its a chicbook this was a pretty sweet western novel.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.,4,False
57, Sometimes you just need a quick fun book.  I read this over Easter weekend and loved every second.  I loved the movie too but the book was better.  This book really wasnt intellectual but it did make one interesting point.  In the book you can only vote if you have gone through and graduated from military training.  This prevents the uneducated and uncommitted citizens from voting.  While this is a bit extreme I might be of the opinion that there should be some more barriers to voting like a standardized test.  Otherwise our elections end up being a marketing contest.  Name recognition is huge in marketing  would W have won otherwise?  Would Hilary have a chance?,4,False
58, If steve recommends it it must be good!,0,False
59, I read this after I went fly fishing for the first time and it was pure gold.  A fantastic story.,5,False
60, One of my favorites from Grisham.  The movie was good to but of course not as good as the book,4,False
61, I havent read a good spy novel in a while  and this was a great one.  Truly well written and an amazing story given how short the book is.  I tore through it in one day!  It really dove into what its like to be in the spy world.  A world where as Le Carre mentions several times in the novel the only rule is to do whats best for your country.  When you play that kind of game morals are thrown out the window.  Murder traitorism disloyalty  are all ok in the name of great good.  And operatives who live in this world have a hard time coming in from the cold  as did Laemas.  The description of how Laemas had to go to personally go to pieces in order to get thrown in jail and get recruited by the Germans was impressive.  He had to basically pretend to become an alcoholic start sucking at his job ostracize all his friends and anyone he met and hit total rock bottom until he was thrown in jail.  Thats impressive.  Not something I think most people could do  which is why the Spy world is such and interesting one.  The issue of the unmorality of the spy world was Liz Laemas love interests main issue with the events.  But Laemas was hardened to it and still looked at it from the greater good angle  though people were killed in the end it was a win for London after all.  It was interesting that the last lines of the novel had him thinking about some kids he almost ran over in his car once: as though he wanted to get back to that place where normal rules applied.,5,False
62, Maybe it was just not a good time but I couldnt get through it... I loved  Of Mice And Men though.,3,False
63, A classic LA detective novel  loved it.  The opening paragraph says it all:  It was about eleven oclock in the morning midoctober with the sun not shining and a look of hard rain in the clearness of the foothills.  I was wearing my powderblue shirt tie and display handkerchief black brogues black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them.  I was neat clean shaved and sober and didnt care who knew it.  I was everything the welldressed private detective ought to be.  I was calling on four million dollars.,5,False
64,  spoiler alert   This book may as well have been called One Hundred Years of Inbreeding And Human Drama.  It was basically a story about a small town where the gene pool is so small that everyone marries their relations and it seems like life spirals more and more downward and out of control over  years.  I really enjoyed the authors ability to bring these crazy characters to life and explain the story behind how each ones quirks strange behavior.  The book started out really strong stagnated a bit for me / of the way in but I loved the ending.  I also thought the inclusion of magical elements throughout the story was an interesting and fun twist.  Melquiadess scrolls the floating priest etc.  According to Wikipedia this is called magical realism.  Thinking about all the movies and TV shows being produced now it seems that this is a common plot element nowadays!,4,False
65, I read this classic twice in high school.  Its hard to like books you read in high school but this one stood out  couldnt tell you why anymore :,5,False
66, Man I wish I hadnt read this yet so I could enjoy it again.,5,False
67, This book was a pure delight.  The subtitle Adventures of a Curious Character is spoton.  Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life thought a series of stories.  One thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things.  You would think a worldfamous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics  but Feynman was curious about everything he saw.  He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun  the list goes on!  My take: you should have your passions  but you should also have your hobbies.  I think I need a new hobby :  I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system.  He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to.  I think this is not a unique problem in education.  Another lesson learned from Feynmans studies of science is to never take any data for granted.  Always always question the sources.  Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would regenerate many of the numbers on his own  even if they had been published in other places.  For many things we are and not just in science standing on the shoulders of giants.  The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with.  I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist with real integrity.  And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles.  This book was a lighthearted attempt to point that out  not to mention a very entertaining read.,5,False

69, This book was pure Gold  it was impossible to put down and its clear to see why its a classic.  Watching Holmes apply his methods to each case and unravel it to the eternaly baffled Watson was entertaining and even inspiring.  I only wish I was as smart as Sherlock.  I actually think we can all learn a lot from Sherlock  even if he is fictional :  Some other interesting things I learned:   sherlock only says elementary once   sherlock does cocaine when bored in between cases .  I guess it wasnt such a big deal back then?   one caper delved into the history of the Mormons which was very interesting,5,False

71, After seeing the movie i liked it and needing a fun read for a vacation this was perfect.  Like Jacques I loved the explanation of Baccarat.  My mental image of Vesper Lynd in the book is much prettier than the actress from the movie.  Flemings Bond is much more of a connoisseur than the movie Bond and he takes great care in describing all the details of the things he enjoys  particularly his cigarettes his food his wine and his car.,5,False
72, I read this while backpacking through Europe after college.  It was a fascinating insight into the Spanish culture  anyone going there should definitely read this.,5,False
73, I know this book is supposed to be evil as its horribly inaccurate but I had a lot of fun reading it so Im still giving it  stars.  sorry jacques,4,False
74, Im a huge james bond fan.  Always have been.  I read a bunch of the books back in high school but missed this one.  I love the books as much as the movies.  Fleming brings the character to life in a very different way from the movies  more human more vulnerable.  Plus the its always interesting to see the differences between the plot of the movie and the book.  In this one for instance there was no space station no Jaws no plot to populate the planet with a superrace.  But there was the millionaire Drax with an evil plan  you can count on that :,4,False
75, I loved this book.  I agree with Elizabeth  the movie wasnt close.  Something about Nicholas Cage trying to do an italian accent?,5,False

78, Really good book.  It read like a bestseller quick read but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think.  three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few the stickyness factor the power of context.  Law of the Few people who influence:   Connectors: super connectors eg Paul Revere.  William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we havent heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a superconnector  knew who to rouse.   Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places.  This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests.  They like to be helpers in the marketplace.   Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion.  Good at reading people entering into conversational harmony with them.  Facial gestures nods smiles frowns are key indicators.  Emotional Mimicry.  Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan.  Stickyness Factor   Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky.  It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness how much kids remembered of each show.

79, Just reread this for the first time and its still one of my favorites.  This book is geekheaven: cryptography world war II codebreaking nazi gold and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story.  It also was largely lost on me and I suspect many of my generation that the second world war was won  or at least greatly accelerated  in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes.  Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs etc was fascinating.  I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex very productive and when he hasnt not very productive.  The codebreaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about as modern day programmers largely dont have to worry about that stuff but its a good reminder to think about as we dont have it on our brains nearly enough.  Avi  Randys paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill on the other hand it also may be wise.  I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before but not in the last  years.  Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that!  If there was a theme to this book its that cryptography is everything.  It defined the second world war and it also defines the modern internet.  Information is king  not large caches of gold.,5,False

I dont remember it so well now but I do remember there being some really interesting tieins to ancient sumarian computers.  That plus any book with a protagonist named Hiro Protagonist who wields badass japanese swords is just badass.  Note: the MetaVerse is current being built now here: http://secondlife.com,4,False

83, Youre the queen.  Im just a commoner.  GAH!!!  MY HEART!!!  This book was everything.  One of the bestsecond chance romances Ive ever read.  Kennedy and Johnny fell in love when they were just in high school.  Johnny was a naturallygifted actor and left his family behind to follow his dreams of becoming an actor.  Kennedy ran away with him to Hollywood when she was just  giving up her dreams to follow his.  Real life brutally intruded and Kennedy left Johnny after he got his first big break.  He quickly got lost in the throes of addiction and the Hollywood party scene.  Brokenhearted and pregnant Kennedy returned home to begin a new life without Johnny.  You dont know this but that girl?  She doesnt need a house.  She doesnt even need an apartment.  She wouldve slept in the car.  She wouldnt have complained at all about it.  You didnt have to sell it but you did and as grateful as she is for that she already feels guilty.  Shes worried and shes scared that this wont be a story of triumph.  Because she believes in you.  She wouldnt be there if she didnt.  But the world isnt always kind to good people.  Sometimes it eats them alive.  Johnny grew up wealthy but in a very abusive household.  Acting was his escape.  He had no choice but to get away from his family in any way he could.  But he never really left his demons behind and now that he is a worldfamous superstar he wants to make amends with Kennedy and with Madison the daughter he never knew.  I dont deserve her time not in the least but Im so desperate for some part of this woman back that Ill steal every second that I can get.  Kennedy gave up everything for Madison a gorgeous smart and funny little girl.  Kennedy works at a deadend job struggling to make ends meet.  She is still in love with Johnny but has been hurt by him many times over the years.  I was SO emotional while reading this book!  It had everything I love about a second chance romance.  The writing is clever and creative and completely engaging.  I fell in love with Johnny and with little Madison!  The book is heartbreaking sexy funny heartfelt and completely uplifting.  Whatever did it Im glad youre sober and I hope you stay that way.  For Maddies sake yeah because she deserves to know her dad but for your sake too.  I know I was never enough for you Jonathan but I hope you find something that is.  This story is perfectly balanced between both the hero and heroines point of view.  I adored the story of how Kennedy and Johnny first met and fell deeply in love.  There are lots of steamy scenes as well as just the right amount of humor to balance out the very emotional story.  This story gripped me from the first page and had me glued to the pages until the very end.  I also loved how Kennedy was loyal and strong and smart and selfsufficient.  She did not need the Porsches or the red carpets or the mansions.  She only wanted Johnny to be able to follow his dreams.  Wherever it takes you Ill be there.  Ghosted is another mustread book from JM Darhower.  One of my favorite books of the year.  Thank you K.  What are you thanking me for?  Giving me a second chance he says.  And a third and a forth and a fifth...  And a twentieth.  He laughs lightly.  And a twentieth.  There wont be a twentyfirst I tell him.  I have to draw the line somewhere.,5,False
84, . Addictive Stars!  Im Easton Royal superficial and only interested in how to have a good time.  I dont want to look deep into my being and see the bottomless black boring pool of nothingness.  I want to live in blissful denial.  I am not a fan of overthetop drama or crazy plots.  So imagine my delight when I read Fallen Heir almost in one sitting!  Addictive funny and fastpaced this book might be my favorite in the series so far.  Easton Royal is a high school senior at the very exclusive Astor Park Prep.  This is a school filled with ultrarich students complete with trust funds and designer clothes and huge mansions.  Easton is a flirt and a partier and sets his sights on the new girl in school Hartley.  They are complete opposites but that is part of the fun of this book.  Hartley is not at all interested in badboy Easton so he settles for the friend zone.  I need to treat her as a friend.  A real giveashitabouteachother dontneedtobenakedtocareaboutyou friend.  This book should not be read as a standalone because it does contain some spoilers from the earlier books.  I am SO glad I stuck with this series because I LOVED Eastons story!  He has a good heart and realizes that his partying is getting out of hand especially as the son of a mother who had severe addiction issues.  I fell in love with Easton and my heart broke for him!  Im the only one here drinking crap I cant stand because I dont want to spend a minute of my life alone.  My heads a bad bad place.  I really felt the connection between Easton and Hartley and loved the supporting characters.  Fallen Heir is a crisply written and juicy story that is perfect for all fans of contemporary Young Adult books.  This book just clicked for me.  And I loved how funny Easton was.  His humor and satire was just what this story needed.  I might be small but I have the lung capacity of a whale so if you dont move Im gonna have to release the oral Kraken until the entire school is in this hallway rescuing me from you.  I crack up.  The oral Kraken?  That sounds pretty dirty.  Im thinking everything sounds dirty to you she says dryly.  This nook ends on a MAJOR cliffhanger which should not be a surprise for fans of this series.  WOW!!  But never fear another book is coming in January!!  I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it if youre looking for a very smart and witty Young Adult story.  Im the design flaw in the Royal family the one who isnt quite like the others the one who crashes and burns more often than not.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
85, I promise to love you forever.  As long as there is love in this world we will be a part of it.  So sweet!!  Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion.  Dont read any spoilers for this book!  Im glad I didnt know anything about it.  Renee Carlinos books ALWAYS captivate me.  Swear on This Life is one of my alltime favorite stories.  I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book.  SIGH Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms.  Carlino.  Impulsive sweet charming creative and loving he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte.  While Im not always a fan of instalove it just WORKED here.  Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed well absolutely perfect.  I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him.  But life has a funny way of working out and things dont turn out quite how Charlotte expected.  There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldnt put my finger on it.  Youre stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it.  Im sorry you didnt like it.  Did I hurt you.?  No but are you going to paint it?  Paint what?  Us what we just did?  No.  No?  No.  I dont need to.  Ill never forget it and its sacred.  The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!!  Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and lets just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined.  Nonetheless he still feels like the one love of her life even though they spent a very short time together.  Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene.  She meets the adorable Seth who is a minorleague baseball player.  He really likes her but she cant quite forget Adam.  Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an allaround wonderful man!!  But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam?  It was like we already knew each other like we had met in a previous life.  Memories that didnt exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks.  This is a lovely romantic bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving.  I also adored all of the characters.  This is not at all a love triangle although I love those too!.  Dont read any spoilers about this one you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind.  The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlinos stories I was sorry to see this one end!  I want you to know that I am grateful to you.  Im grateful to you now.  I got to experience IT in this life and I dont think its measured with time.  You dont think whats measured with time Adam?  Love Charlotte.

86, . Kinky Stars!  Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story!  But she also manages to be funny heartfelt and utterly original.  Highly recommend!  Everyone is weird Kate were the perfect kind of weird for each other.  Yes this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect!  Eve Dangerfield writes smart funny nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable.  Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame.  The focus of her current obsession is her boss Ty a  year old gruff sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons.  Her obsession wasnt even original.  Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson.  Women gay men straight men more perceptive animals.  It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brotherit made you basic as hell.  But she thinks Ty cant stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her.  He never speaks to her calls her by her work nickname and is generally just an allaround grouch.  But...but...shes actually perfect for him!  Because you see Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more.  Ty didnt think Middleton was a great girl.  He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass.  Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice being cuter than a fistful of buttons.  Where did she get off?  This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldnt believe what I was reading!  But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page.  And the letter he writes to Kate!!  OMG.  Faints  Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings.  I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered.  Ty was another story.  He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted.  Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology wanting to cherish her was something else.  Something much worse.  This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes.  Eve Dangerfield is fearless!  And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was.  Ty glared at her.  Think youre funny dont you Middleton?  Yes.  Well well see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire.  This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there.  Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea then do not read this one.  BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink as I am then by all means read Act Your Age!  It is pure growly Alphamale goodness through and through.  I cant wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next!  What he and Middleton shared had gravity it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
87, Out of all the places we could be were right here.  At the same time.  Colleen Hoover is at the top of my autobuy list.  Without question.  And she returns to her Young Adult stories in Without Merit.  Merit Voss is a teenage girl who in addition to the normal angst of young adulthood lives in a very unconventional household.  From her perspective her family is just plain WEIRD.  No one can seem to get along and most poignantly no one really seems to notice Merit at all.  She almost seems like an afterthought.  I can say with certainty that we live in the most unusual house in this whole town.  I say house because it is certainly not a home.  And inside this house are seven of the most unusual occupants.  No one would be able to determine from the outside of our house that our family of seven includes an atheist a home wrecker an exwife suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia and a teenage girl whose weird obsession borders on necrophilia.  Of course Merit is a classic unreliable narrator and slowly the truth about her family emerges.  Colleen Hoover knows how to treat delicate subjects with great dignity and care.  She makes the entire cast of odd characters here sympathetic and very likable even though you may think the opposite of them at first.  Merit decides to just stop attending school.  No one seems to even notice!  While skipping school she meets a cute guy and they share an earthshattering kiss.  BUT Merit actually has a twin sister named Honor and the cute guy is actually Sagan her twins boyfriend.  It seems as though Sagan might have thought he was kissing Honor.  Merit is angry and surly and cant seem to make many friends.  She is offended when Sagan starts eating meals with the family and basically moving in.  How could this have happened?  Im confused by two things.  One being the constant and repeated presence of Honors boyfriend at our breakfast table.  Two being the fact that everyone seems to know him so well that theyre perfectly fine with him joining in on the family conversation.  Merit eventually uncovers some very hard truths about her familys past.  It also becomes very clear that Honor is not the perfect person that she at first thinks herself to be.  Like all of Colleen Hoovers characters Merit is unforgettable.  She must make some hard choices about herself her family and Sagan.  Sagan just doesnt say mean things out loud.  Maybe thats a product of how he was raised.  Or maybe hes some kind of saint.  Or an angel brought to earth to test my morals.  I loved the message of this book!!  The story is beautiful and the characters feel real and flawed and very relatable.  The description of smalltown Texas seems spoton.  Fans of Colleen Hoover will devour this story and hopefully new readers will pick this one up and see why her readers are so devoted to her writing.  Unconditional love loyalty and forgiveness are some heavy topics but Ms.  Hoover serves them up perfectly here.  Not every mistake deserves a consequence.  Sometimes the only thing a mistake deserves is forgiveness.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
88, .   Stars  It wouldve been romantic if I wasnt drunk as a skunk when I dialed him.  I am a diehard Penelope Ward fan.  I DEVOUR her books.  And this one started off very strong for me!  I loved the premise of the story: uglyduckling Rana finds her childhood friend Landon online when she is drunk one night and calls him and unleashes years of pentup frustration.  Rana grew up very poor in Michigan and her family rented their apartment from Landons family.  She was forced to suddenly move when she was young and lost touch with her former best friend Landon.  However the truth turns out to be a little different than what Rana was told and she and Landon begin to talk on the phone and it becomes very clear they both have very strong feelings for each other.  Penelope Ward is the queen of secondchance romance as well as creating a sold backstory for her characters.  I didnt quite feel that connection between Rana and Landon but many readers loved this one so definitely give it a try.  The story has some very valuable messages about selfesteem and forgiveness.  And the sexy times are incredibly HOT!!  I would have liked a little more buildup to the fullblown relationship between Landon and Rana.  BUT I did fall in the love with Landon: like all of Ms.  Wards main characters he is simply unforgettable!  His hands may have been calloused his arms may have been inked he may have looked dangerous but Landon was as gentle as he was protective.  Drunk Dial is a light and sexy story that delivers a HEA.  While it is not my favorite Penelope Ward book I nonetheless enjoyed reading it and loved the secondchance friends to lovers storyline.  This is a sexy passionate and often funny book with lots of emotion.  Enjoy Landon Roderick!  I know I did.  Our story was a lot like a Rubiks Cube  colourful and complicated.  It took years to work it out but then suddenly like magic on a random Sunday everything all came together.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
89, If you love a sweet verrrry sexy lowangst romance then this is the book for you!  Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward cooked up another very readable yet superhot contemporary romance.  Dr.  Simon Hogue is a sexy British physician who meets singlemom Bridget in the cutest way possible.  Both are single: Bridget is a widowed nurse with not much of a social life and Simon is a gorgeous doctor with no interest in a relationship.  Theres tons of humor sexy talk and a hottie British doctor.  Whats not to love?  After an embarrassing meet cute with Simon Bridget ends up renting a room in her home to him in order to make ends meet.  Its not permanent: Simon is only in the US to complete his residency and then he will be back off to Britain.  He loves to tease Bridget and their attraction is mutual.  So he proposes a deal: a nostrings attached sexonly relationship until he leaves.  The authors put a fresh spin on the friendstolovers trope that is sexy and enticing.  Theres not much angst but the storyline is fastpaced and engaging.  Bridget doesnt want her son to get too attached to Simon so she is careful not to get attached.  But Simon soon finds himself falling in love with Bridget and her son too.  The sexy blond god of a doctor whom Id masturbated to for weeks after the fish hook incident...was now my roommate.  This is a swoony romance with lots of heart and tons of heat.  The authors always throw in a twist for dramatic tension and it worked perfectly here!  The letterwriting is a cute addition and I loved the funny charming dirtytalking Brit!!  Another passionate sweet and heartwarming story from a great writing duo.  Its proof you hooked me from the very beginning luv.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
90, . Stars  This was my first book by Jeannine Colette and I really enjoyed it!  Nothing too over the top here just a sweet and sexy smalltown romance featuring one hot cop and a feisty heroine.  Leah is determined to own the bar where she works and I loved that aspect of the book.  The author also seems to have a wicked sense of humor which shows in the funny banter and the hilarious Matthew McConaughey references.  Leah lost her first love to an overdose and he also happened to be Adams best friend  Adam the rigid bythebook policeman who seems determined to punish Leah for her past mistakes.  Adam is charitable and gorgeous and kind and protective.  He has made it his mission in life to rid the town of narcotics.  When Leah is sentenced to community service under Adams supervision the sparks begin to fly.  Even though the setting is in the Midwest this story has almost a sassy Southern feel to it reminiscent of Abbi Glines and Harper Sloans early books.  I love a bluecollar hero and Luke fits the bill perfectly!  Adam was cold and harsh and downright mean for much of the story until Leah begins to break through to him.  The chemistry between these two was HOT HOT HOT!  I applaud Ms.  Colette for her strong and sassy heroine and absolutely loved Leah.  She wasnt just a party girl and earns the respect of everyone around her.  Wrecked is a funny sexy smalltown romance that is a great way to spend a few hours.

91,   . Stars!  If I ever lay eyes on you again... I cant promise Ill do whats best and walk away next time...  Fancy a fastpaced wellwritten sexy romance?  The Forbidden is all that and more!!  This is not so much a taboo romance as it is the story of two people who simply meet at the wrong time.  Annie is an upandcoming careerdriven architect who has no time for relationships.  She has just never felt that spark with any man.  Jack and Annie meet one night in a bar when she is out for a fun night with friends.  They have an immediate connection that only JodiEllen Malpas can make seem SO real.  Jacks marriage was over long before he met Annie.  While some might see this as a bright line that should never be crossed Jack instead seemed to me to be sweet vulnerable and craving an intimate connection.  Annie for one cannot believe she has found herself in this situation but Jack is everything she never knew she wanted.  I would never have put myself in this situation for anything less than powerful love.  The kind that keeps you going.  The kind that gives you breath and life.  Jacks my life.  Hes my pulse.  Hes everything.  This story would be empty and unconvincing in the hands of a less talented writer.  But JEM really creates nuanced characters with hard choices to make.  Nothing is black and white here.  While the story got a little too overdramatic for me near the end I nonetheless loved this book and highly recommend it!  Im in hell and Im in heaven.  Im flying and Im drowning.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
92, The First Taste features Andrew a single dad from Slip of the Tongue one of my favorite books.  His story is a standalone and does NOT feature any forbidden romance.  Andrew is the complete opposite of Amelia the boss of his sister and a total TypeA workaholic.  She has been burned by a painful split from her husband and is going through a very difficult divorce.  Amelia and Andrew make is clear from the start they are both only looking for a onenight stand with no strings attached.  Andrew does not suffer from lack of women thats for sure  hes totally hot has his own business and has an adorable daughter named Bell who is raising on his own.  They are both completely honest with each other from the start but begin to develop a deeper connection.  Their emotional relationship develops slowly even though they both are wary of getting close.  Amelia is stunning smart and selfsufficient Never in a million years does she think she could ever fall for a man like Andrew!  And Andrews daughter comes first even while it becomes obvious his daughter would love for him to fall in love.  I loved that Andrew was the one who actually starts to realize that he is falling in love with Amelia and wants more from her.  Somewhere along the way she became worth it to me.  The threat of pain that comes with keeping her in my lifeits not enough to scare me away.  In fact its the threat of competition that stokes a fire in me.  It makes me want to put up a fight.  The First Taste is a classic oppositesattract story filled with real emotion and characters that have depth and honesty.  Jessica Hawkins is great at writing ubersexy men and Andrew is not only gorgeous and tatted he is a VERY giving lover.  The sexy times in The First Taste are without a doubt some of the steamiest around.  I want to undress you stretch you out on my bed fingers to toes.  Your hair splayed on my pillow and I want to take you over and over until you cant handle it another second.  I love stories with single dads and while this story did not pack as much of an emotional punch as Slip of the Tongue I still loved the story and the way Amelia and Andrews relationship grew and developed.  This is a fast and sexy read from an incredibly talented writer and I cant wait to read whats next!  Have I ever mentioned how it feels when Im the reason for your smile?  Like a million bucks.

93, Grabbing a bite.  With a twentyyearold.  From a boy band.  Under what circumstance might that ever be construed as acceptable?  I. LOVED.  THIS.  BOOK.  A sharp and insightful commentary on our modern culture and obsession with celebrity The Idea of You is also a fantastic sexy romance.  This book really did it for me.  If this is Robinne Lees first book I cannot wait see what comes next!  Solene is a sophisticated  year old divorced working mom who finds herself swept up into an exciting and sexy relationship with the worldfamous Hayes Campbell the  year old member of a famous boy band.  She is an educated and successful gallerist who is divorced from her exhusband who has a younger girlfriend.  The world does not take kindly to Solenes relationship with Hayes mainly because of the  year age difference.  I loved the commentary on ageism in our society today.  The public will accept an older man with a younger girlfriend but frowns upon the older woman/younger man dynamic.  Solene is acutely aware of the age difference but is enjoying an awakening of sorts with Hayes Ah the joys of a younger boyfriend!  What starts out as just lunch soon becomes much much more.  I just want to look at you for a moment.  Youve been looking at me for over an hour.  Yeah but before I was trying not to be obvious about it.  Come here.  He led me over to the daybed against the far wall and pulled me onto his lap.  I could feel him through his pants.  Oh the wonders of twenty.  Solene at first tries to hide her relationship with Hayes from her young daughter.  I knew this was going to be a disaster and her daughter at first does not handle the news well at all.  But doesnt Solene deserve to be happy?  She struggles not only with her exhusbands reaction to the news but also with her daughters.  The entire time Isabelle had been just across the hall on the phone with her friend oblivious to her mother going down the rabbit hole.  Facefirst.  One of the things I loved most about this book was the sharp look at our obsession with celebrity.  Hayes could not go anywhere without being mobbed and even a causal trip to the store to buy a shirt led to a mob scene.  He was used to it Solene was not.  This story made me rethink every headline I read about celebrities.  Hayes wanted Solene to know him and NOT the idea of him.  Hayes was tender sweet funny sexy and much wiser than his  years.  You want to be kissed Solene?  His hands were in my hair pushing it off of my face cradling my neck.  Yes.  I nodded.  You think you can handle that?  Ill see what I can do.  Robinne Hill gets her locations right.  From Miami to Malibu to Manhattan and Paris I felt as if I was THERE experiencing the cafes the clubs the chic art galleries and the screaming fans at the huge concerts.  This book really checked all the boxes for me!!  I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.  I am having a hard time moving on from this book.  Would I love a sequel?  YES.  But I would also gladly welcome another book from Ms.  Hill.  Grab The Idea of You and enjoy a fabulous time with this perfect beach read.  I adored it.  Favorite quotes:  Youre making me blush he laughed tipping his head back.  His jawline from this angle was welldefined exquisite like art.  His beauty like a gift that kept revealing itself.  Love she said was not always perfect and not exactly how you expected it to be.  But when it descended upon you there was no controlling it.

94,   . Stars!  OMG!!  Refreshing smart fun and swoony I LOVED this book!!  It was just what I needed.  My favorite R.S.  Grey book since Scoring Wilder.  If you are looking for something totally light and sexy this book is for you!  Madeleine is an adorable and quirky heroine who is trying her best to get her life together.  As a somewhat unsuccessful realtor she adores her giant dog named Mouse cute right?  and loves her family and best friend Daisy.  But her love life?  Nonexistent.  DOA.  That is until the new veterinarian Dr.  Adam Foxe arrives in town.  But the good doctor is coming off a bitter breakup and is cynical and not looking for love etc etc.  Until Mouse and Madeleine crash into his life!  They strike up a mutually beneficial deal.  A fake dating arrangement to satisfy Adams nosy family and he will buy a house through Madeleine.  Let the hilarity and hormones ensue!  No.  No.  A family barbecue is serious!  This was not part of the deal.  Technically you agreed to do anything I needed you to do.  Thats when I thought youd be asking me for a lung or something!  So you were prepared to donate an organ but a family barbecue is suddenly too much pressure?  Dont try to be cute.  Adams family is charmed by Madeleine.  And who wouldnt be?  She is a sincere and honest and refreshingly REAL MC.  And you brought cookies?  she asks eyeing the Tupperware in my hand.  Freshly baked this morning I brag.  She turns over her shoulder to Adam whos following us into the house with Mouse by his side.  I love her already!  I bask in her praise.  After the months from hell Ive had recently this is a muchneeded reprieve.  Hell if all else fails maybe Ill date Adams mom?  The Foxe  the Hound is a delightfully sexy story with the perfect amount of humor and heat.  I loved the banter the characters and the charming smalltown Texas setting.  I swear R.S.  Grey could be a TV comedy writer thats how funny her dialogue is!  I want to take a pair of scissors to her loud highlights but I misplaced the scissors I usually keep in my top drawer a few months ago.  Instead Im forced to stand hang up on Daisy and follow Lori over to the conference room with pen and paper in hand.  Were the first two to arrive.  She takes her usual spot beside Helens chair and I pick a spot on the opposite end of the table.  Her perfume is strong.  Chanel number five she told me once bragging.  Oh really?  On you it smells like a number two.  This was THE perfect read for a summer day or a weekend at the beach.  I fell in love with Adam and Madeleine and the fictional setting of Hamilton Texas.  Bravo Ms.  Grey!!  Keep writing more books like this one.  We should slow down I sputter just before his mouth falls to my chest.  He swirls his tongue around my nipple and my eyes pinch closed.  Or yknow speed up even more.,4,False
95, .   stars  Beautiful and poignant yet very violent spinoff from the Nine Minutes series.  Lots of unexpected twists and turns!  I loved the storyline and the originality of the plot.  Even though I was familiar with Anthony Bear and Christy from the Nine Minutes series this book really explored their relationship and Anthonys early life.  I could not WAIT for this book to come out since Beth Flynn is a very special and talented writer.  The Nine Minutes Series is one of my alltime FAVORITE biker romances and I recommend it to anyone who will listen!  Anthony is a fighter.  Faced with racism from a young age he clawed his way to the top and created one of the most feared and most successful illegal businesses on the West Coast of Florida.  He is Boss.  When a large debt is owed to him he sets out to collect.  He kidnaps the daughter of the man who owes him but Christy Chapman is not at all what he expected.  Anthony has preconceived notions about her which turn out to be all wrong.  Christy judged Anthony at first too.  Not quite the pampered heiress that Anthony thought she was they both surprise each other along the way.  Although I finished this book it was a little slow going for me at times.  The thirdperson voice prevented me from really connecting with these characters.  That being said this was an incredibly inventive story and as always I ADORE the Florida setting of Beth Flynns books.  The colorful characters and unflinching violence add to the genuine feel of the plot.  I hope that there are more books planned for the Beth Flynns cast of characters because I will be first in line to read her next book!

96, .   Stars!  When life happened it did it in a heartbeat.  That space between time.  A first inhale a last exhale.  The dawn of realization the eve of what was and never again would be.  What an unexpected and refreshing surprise!!!  This book is unlike anything Ive ever read.  And please dont read any spoilers!  The author just totally blew me away with the plot and the characters and the FEELS!  Let me just say that Parker was one of my favorite MCs EVER.  Strong funny selfdeprecating she is basically just waiting for her life to begin.  She has a chip on her shoulder and blames everyone else for the position shes in.  But there is so much more to her story!  If Amazon Prime offered a life she would have oneclicked the hell out of it and selected recurring monthly delivery.  This book is NOT what you think.  The plot is inventive and sexy and emotional.  It is pure Jewel E. Ann.  This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I did not want it to end!  Parker finds herself in THE one situation that she swore she would never be in.  Funny how life is right?  Despite her best intentions she realizes that life is not black and white but is shades of grey.  And family does mean everything.  Temptation no longer resided in his blind spot.  She lived a hundred yards away.  This book is funny and steamy and just plain REAL.  I am trying not to give away any of the plot because this book is best read without knowing anything about the story or the characters.  It is another delightfully different story from one of the best indie authors writing today.  Pick up When Life Happened.  You will be delighted and challenged and entertained.  The truth doesnt always set you free and lies are not always deception.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
97, . Captivating Stars!!  When truth is replaced by silence the silence is a lie.   Yevgeny Yevtushenko  The Childs is a haunting and emotional characterdriven suspense novel that also explores our modernday obsession with / news.  Angelas newborn baby was kidnapped from her hospital room several decades earlier.  The baby was never found.  Angela and her husband Nick carried on after their devastating loss but Angela never fully recovered.  When the bones of an infant are found at a construction site she is sure the body is that of her longgone Baby Alice.  Kate is a brilliant newspaper journalist who uncovers news stories the oldfashioned way: through leg work and research and determination.  She was also featured in the authors previous book The Widow which I am now going to read!  I loved Kates style.  While this book started off just a tiny bit slow it picked up the pace in the middle and thundered toward an unbelievably shocking conclusion.  Ive always thought thats a funny saying.  Let sleeping dogs lie.  Because sleeping dogs always wake up eventually dont they?  Emma is married to a university professor many years her senior.  She is devastated by the news of the Building Site Baby but why?  She has no apparent ties to Angelas family.  Emma has had a difficult relationship with her mother Jude but it seems the two are trying to make peace with each other now that Emma is grown and married.  But Emma has secrets of her own that will devastate everyone close to her when they are revealed.  The multiple points of view are executed brilliantly.  Each narrator has their own unique voice and are each vital to the story.  The Child is an imaginative and surprising thriller.  While the writing is filled with British slang and customs that only added to my enjoyment of the story.  There are many twists and turns to this book and the ending was far more touching than I expected from what I though would be a suspense novel.  The conclusion was enormously satisfying!  Highly recommend this book for all thriller fans as well as anyone who loves a great story.  People say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger.  They say that when you been through something terrible ... But it doesnt.  It breaks your bones leaving everything splintered and held together with grubby bandages and yellowing sticky tape.  Creaking along the fault lines Fragile and exhausting to hold together.  Sometimes you wish it had killed you.  With thanks to the publisher for a review copy.,5,False
98, Such a sweet and sexy story!  Highly recommend this one for fans of KA  this book is all about a strong heroine a standup Alpha hero and some fastmoving danger.  Loved the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana scenery.  Im a HUGE fan of secondchance romance and this one fit the bill perfectly.  This is the second book in the Jamison Valley series and centers around Nick Jesses friend.  This book can be read as a standalone but I HIGHLY recommend the first book because it is fantastic!  Its no spoiler that Nick and Emmeline Emmy were married in Las Vegas many years earlier and surprise!  They meet up again very unexpectedly after many years apart when she moves to his small town.  Nick?  Gigi asked but I didnt speak or take my eyes off Emmy.  She was frozen just like I was.  Finally Emmy broke away.  Sorry.  I have to go she mumbled before racing to the door.  What was that?  Do you know her?  Jess asked.  Yeah.  I knew her.  Shes my wife.  There is a delicious slowburn aspect to this story even though Nick and Emmy are still legally married.  Emmy now has a boyfriend and had given up ever finding Nick after years of searching turned up nothing theres a good reason for that which is revealed later in the book!.  Nick broke her heart when he left her after their impulsive wedding in Vegas.  Emmy and Nick were from two very different worlds but now their paths have crossed again when she takes a teaching job in Prescott Montana.  Nick is a sexy and sweet Alpha but Emmy resists him despite his incredibly tender and romantic gestures.  Even though they are husband and wife they really didnt know each other at all.  If you are a fan of smalltown romance you will love this book.  There is plenty of action and just the right amount of heat.  Although story did not have the wow factor that The Coppersmith Farmhouse had I still raced through this book and absolutely fell in love with the characters.  I am obsessed with this series and cannot wait for more stories about the other characters.  Ms.  Perry obviously has a great deal of love for her setting and it shows in her writing.  The Clover Chapel is a heartwarming funny sexy and very adult romance that enthralled me and entertained me to the very last word.  I am thrilled that the third book in the series The Lucky Heart is coming in August!  I cant wait to return to Jamison Valley.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
99, Now I know how much there is to be afraid of and it terrifies me.  But at the same time I feel like if I could live through that what happened to us then I can survive anything.  Like what is there really to be afraid of?  This book has SO much going for it!  A Bittersweet friendstolovers story a feisty and relatable heroine AND a badboy hero.  Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and Lick remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books.  For those reasons I stuck with this story and Im so glad that I did.  Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that I applaud Ms.  Scott.  For once the ordinary girl gets the guy!  Kissing John was everything.  Well not everything everything.  I wouldnt die without him.  But all of me wanted him my heart and my head and all of the rest.  Without a doubt he made life better.  John and Edie experienced a lifechanging trauma and it pretty much bonds them together.  No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers families and friends.  They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying fatshaming and teenage angst.  There are some lighthearted moments in this story as well and if Ms.  Scott writes more YA novels I will be first in line!  With that said there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit there seemed to be some Aussiespeak thrown in  no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used but all in all this was a sweet funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end.  Youre here?  Yeah.  Why?  Because this is where you are he said as if it were obvious.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
100, . Big Red Stars!  OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books Ive ever read!  Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story.  Youre stunning he said eyeing her up and down.  His irises werent watery blue like most redheads but a warm caramel brown.  Ashs lady areas tingled as though they too craved a cigarette.  Thanks.  Can I keep this review clean?  Hard to do based on how naughty this book is.  Ashley is a hardworking nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends.  What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor.  A former model Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lowerclass background and loser parents.  Raised by her grandmother she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything.  Julias boyfriend Max has a gorgeous redheaded roommate named Dean.  A big lovable bear of a man Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash thats IT for him.  And Ash feels the same.  A ginger?  No way!  He wasnt a pretty boy his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided but he had that squarejawed saltoftheearth handsome look that made a girl think of loosehipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds.  And speaking of Scottish Lairds old mate was a redhead.  Usually gingers werent her scene but this guys hair was the rich copperyauburn of a foxs pelt.  It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head.  Big Red was doing it for her.  Big time.  And apparently the feeling was mutual.  Dean is one of the most original MCs Ive ever had the pleasure of reading.  Sensitive kind loving he wears his heart on his sleeve.  Trouble is he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought.  Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her!  What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read.  You women always trying to rush straight to sex.  Whatever happened to romance?  Dean and Ash were perfect together.  Theres tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story.  Between the Princess Bride references the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes this book was a win for me.  The dialogue crackles and the characters are all wellwritten and so REAL.  I cant put my finger on what makes a book work for me but Open Hearts has it.  I couldnt book this book down!  Filled with heat heart and humor Open Hearts is one of my favorite books this year.  Favorite quotes:  He had to be sixfour or five lean but beefy everywhere it counted.  How would all that weight feel bearing down on her?  She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized py. Everything below her belly button tightened.  Theyd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour.  He was just what his mum called away with the fairies and Max called a bit of a lost  ct.  Youre my dream girl Ash.  No one even comes close.,5,False
101, He was so addictive.  Like candy.  Or drugs.  One taste of him had me fiending and my heart beating out of my chest.  OH YES!!!  I loved this fun and spicy slowburn sports romance!!  Illegal Contact has the perfect mix of romance and heat.  Any sportsromance lover will adore this story!  Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues.  A tough guy who grew up in the foster system he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result is put on six months of house arrest.  What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair.  Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole.  And he does little to nothing to dispel the publics opinion of him.  In reality he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle.  He trusts no one outside his tightknit circle.  But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home a stunning mansion in the Hamptons he is forced by his longtime manager to hire a PA to shop for him cook his meals and run his errands.  But Gavin is deadset against this idea because he really doesnt like most people and he just wants to be left alone.  I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete and yet people still treated me like a dirtpoor street kid from Newark.  Some things never changed.  Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job.  His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off.  His student loans are looming over his head.  He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm.  And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either.  He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible.  He is out of options and will take any job even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work.  Was that the celebrity Id be servicing?  Bad choice of words.  Was that the celebrity Id be .  personally assisting?  I wasnt too clear on what this job would even entail.  Id just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joes receptionist.  Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first!  Gavin is a total jerk to Noah.  The man I hired has worked for movie stars Gavin.  He understands discretion.  I dont give a shit if he understands quantum physics.  Hes more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion.  I adore an enemiestolovers story.  Gavin and Noah could not be more different.  Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA.  Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin.  So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley.  Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual he feels that coming out would ruin his football career.  Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike to friendship to sweet sweet romance.  I could not put this story down!  The sex scenes are CRAZY hot.  Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart I just knew these two had to have a HEA.  And boy did they ever.  I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together.  It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lustsoaked voice.  We were both in trouble.  When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah it is a beautiful thing.  The banter the sexy flirting the touches of humor  it all worked for me.  There is a second book planned in this series for Gavins friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome.  I already miss these guys!  Gavin cocked a brow.  If you think Im going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes I suggest you readjust your expectations.  FYIafter showering I air dry.,4,False
102, . Stars  I am one of Katys biggest fans and read everything she writes!  I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas!  Strong driven and brilliant I loved everything about him.  Its never been a game with you.  Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her startup company.  She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful.  But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground.  Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before.  I loved the secondchance romance aspect of this story!  Along with the New Your City setting this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans trademark brand of HOT sexiness.  Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business?  Hes the biggest what if Ive ever had in my life.  The one you always wonder about.  Theres some drama here but it works in the story.  I loved Aarics point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth.  He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end.  The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fastpaced and enjoyable contemporary romance.  I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger the flashback scenes left me wanting more!  If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of secondchance romance you will love this one!  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,3,False
103, . Stars  Holy moly!!!  What to say about this delicious erotic COMPLETELY taboo romance?  Enter at your own risk!!  Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster  my emotions were all over the place.  Ms.  Saffron Kent is an author to watch.  And Professor Thomas Abrams?  I honestly have no words.  Some books have it  an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesnt let go.  The Unrequited has it.  Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance I simply could not put it down.  Bravery is like falling in love.  You donaEURtmt know if the person will reciprocate but still you fall.   Heed the warnings in the synopsis and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating then move along.  But there is SO much more to this book!  Thomas and Laylas story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated.  And so so erotic!  The Harlot fell in love with the Firebreather.  It was beautiful and right.  It was wrong and ugly just like the earth beneath my feet.  It was tragic and ecstatic.  It was everything IaEURtmd hoped love could be.  Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists.  Layla is passionate selfdeprecating very open and brutally honest.  She is a true original.  Thomas is brilliant sexy introspective and sarcastic.  Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love.  She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy.  She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head.  He is rude to her and sees through her charade.  But Thomas has secrets too.  Yes he is married but there is much much more to his story than just that simple fact.  Cold aloof and arrogant he is the complete opposite of Layla.  You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together but you just cant look away.,4,False
104, You smile like the devil Mona said.  The devil doesnt smile he said.  The devil smirks.  STUNNING!!  Ms.  Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica.

Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy interwoven with mythology history and lush eroticism.  Is this all a dream?  Thats the only thing that makes any sense.  You arent dreaming he said and she knew that was true.  She was awake and had been every time they had met.  But if you were a dream would you want to wake up?  he asked.  A good question.  A fair question.  A hard question but one she answered easily.  Never.  I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story.  It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying!  I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm.  This book is unlike anything Ive ever read.  Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill.  The Red is a mustread for all erotic romance lovers!

105, We got here baby through fire and blades demons and curses blood and plagues.  Just WOW.  I had high hopes for Fury and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!!  A gritty incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride.  Put this one on your mustread list!  Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?  This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre.  There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre.  From the minute we first meet Lenore she is tortured anguished an abused.  Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire.  Finger never forgets Lenore.  She is branded onto his soul.  Theres is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied.

But through it all Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts.  Hell and heaven.  Beautiful and horrible.  We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between.  No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget the scars never allowed it.  Fury is a total rollercoaster ride of emotions.  It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees!  Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book.  AND as if there wasnt enough to love about this story I fell in love with Tania!  HELLO.  My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life.  Fury delivers that and then some.  Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending.

107, Im curious whether you could ever like me whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me.  Sweet and lovely and important and fresh.  Love the message of this book!  Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE.  On the one hand is Tanner a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is On the other hand is Sebastian a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church.  Where homosexuality is forbidden.  Tanner moved from California to Provo Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there.  Although out to his family he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates friends and the town.  He falls hard for Sebastian when he meets Seb in a writing class.  Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town.  He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class.  The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course.  Come on.  I moved here when I was fifteenwhich I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto California to Provo Utahwith a mouth full of metal and no friends.  I have stories.  Not to mention Im a halfJewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town.  Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated.  He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted.  Sebastian helps Tanner with his book.  Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay?  But how can I send my heart to him when hes just said in no uncertain terms that he doesnt speak its language?  My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner.  Yes they did fall in love.  And Sebastians religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family.  He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never ever accept his sexual orientation.  So perfect from the outside his family was actually intensely judgmental.  I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two.  This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL.  While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church and his desire to live an authentic life.  How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love.  There are no evil characters here.  Sebastians parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years.  That is what they did and that is what is expected of Sebastian.  This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are.  When Sebastian finally realizes that he has already broken Tanners heart.  This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way.  Seb and Tanner were hot for each other.  It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality but Sebs parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner.  These are two sweet loyal kind and funny boys.  They deserve happiness!  I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love.  Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave.  I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a halfJew in a Mormon town was overused I got it the first  times it was mentioned .  Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books.  That takes me out of the book.  If that part is fictional what else about the LDS is made up?  Thats my dilemma.  Hopefully the LDS Church will have a revelation soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families friends and church.  To think that God loves the trees but condemns that blossoming thing they do in the spring.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
108, First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books.  And this book was a perfectly sexy fastpaced and truly engrossing story.  And the cover...WOW!!  One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book.  The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic.  Just what I love in a contemporary romance.  Valentina has been hurt by her husband William and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there.  Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife and rekindle their love for each other.  Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again.  She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day and falls in love with the city.  My arms outstretched Id danced to the vibrant music of life.  I prayed for romance adventure the unknown.  I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return.  I wanted the turmoil the stress the upheaval and chaosthe Sturm und Drang.  And Sebastien.  HOLY HELL!!  I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!!  A sexy French artist what could be bad non?  Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris what his artistic process was just nothing.  I would have loved some discussion of his art.  Something to fill out this part of the storyline.  But I digress.  Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect.  Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful kind and sweet Valentina.  I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina.  She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien.  One day youre going to stop running away from me.  And when that day finally comes Ill be here waiting for you he whispers softly his words a caress.  Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesnt please me to share you with others after all.  There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part.  The plot just descended for me into soapopera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine  but it just didnt work for me here.  Fans of Mia Asher will love this book it just was not a favorite of mine.  I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books!  Favorite quote:  Il ny a quun bonheur dans la vie cest daimer et detre aime.  There is only one happiness in life to love and be loved.  Our bodies are covered in sweat.  The room smells like our dirty souls.  And I fucking love it.  There are others with far more classical features than hers.  But none of them can hold a candle to her.  She reminds me of the sea: untamed unpredictable but beautiful so damn beautiful.,4,False
109, .   GORGEOUS STARS  No rules.  Live out loud.  Find the sunshine.  Simply stunning!!  Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction.  Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart!  Called a contemporary romance with paranormal elements I found this book to be incredibly moving and very very touching.  I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance.  And please dont be put off by this being the second book in a series.  I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot.  This book is a total standalone!  Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life.  For Nik he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica.  And when they meet it is pure magic.  But it wasnt what was wrong with me anymore.  It was what was right.  The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin and when I inhaled it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away.  The thrumming life all around me grew quiet.  For the first time I felt close to peace and I wanted more.  What begins as a onenight stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep unbreakable connection.  Emma Scotts love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read!  Nikolai Alexei she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness.  Who are you?  There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes.  But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love.  Once again I wont soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott.  A mustread!  Love and hope she said.  Thats life to me.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
110, .   Stars!!  You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you your character is what you really are.  Run dont walk to read this fantastic sports romance!!  I am officially in love with Mariana Zapatas writing.  This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me.  I cant get enough!  I adore her strong heroines.  Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown.  Shes driven focused and yes a little socially awkward.  She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol the superstar Reiner Kulti is going to be one of her teams assistant coaches.  I just sat there with the phone still to my face lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where Id grown up soaking in the idea that Reiner Kultithe Reiner Kulti was going to be my coach.  I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down.  No big deal.  Right.  Oh and she also was sure that one day she and Kulti would be married.  She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed.  Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else.  To my absolute horror my inner thirteenyearold the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccerplaying superbabies with him peeked in and reminded me shed been around once.  Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff.  He is surly silent and downright mean to everyone players and fans alike.  But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human just like everyone else no better and no worse and gradually they reach a truce and an understanding.  They actually become friends with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesnt trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal.  This book is a fantastic enjoyable slowburn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish.  There is just something about Mariana Zapatas writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL.  My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti.  BUT do not expect installove here.  In fact I wasnt even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation let alone fall in love!  I used to have a huge crush on you.  The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch  that would just make me look like I had something to hide.  Which I did but it wasnt like I wanted him to know that once upon a time thered been posters of him all over my wall.  Or that Sal loves Kulti had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school.  Used to.  Used.  To.  I was a little kid back then.  Kulti seems hostile to everyone including Sal.  She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that its cracked up to be and that Kulti really cant lead a normal life.  Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff.  But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German.  Im not going to lie not even a little bit.  Besides a big butt I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages.  While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent.  Okay thirty percent minimum.  But it wasnt like I could or would think about that too much.  He was my coach.  And I was his friend.  Or something like that.  This book is funny sexy romantic exciting actionpacked...need I say more?  Even if you are not a fan of sports romance you will fall in love with Kulti.  The author either really knows the sport of soccer or football depending on your country or she did some phenomenal research.  The story was a pure delight from beginning to end.  The last  of the book had me in tears!!  I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!!  Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes.  Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story.  This book is a mustread!  This he pointed between us.  This is what matters.  You are my gift my second chance and I will cherish you and your dream.  I will protect both of you.,5,False
111, . Stars  LOVE LOVE LOVE this series!  While not a standalone American Prince is just as magical and enticing as the first book.  Without giving too much away this book is Embrys story.  Badboy Embry who grows up to become the VicePresident of the United States.  But he has always felt unworthy of love friendship and trust.  I grew up around power around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility.  Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of other people were worth only how much fun they could give me.  I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble.  Poor Embry!  He is selfless and misunderstood.  I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does.  I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer.  Yet another book by Ms.  Simone that I could NOT put down!  And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship I see it clearly now.  Embry holds my husbands heart in his hands and he doesnt even know it.  Hes too busy looking at the details of Ashs faces to see the expression too busy being in love to see how loved he is.  One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters choices or their lifestyle.  They are just themselves.  Always honest with other and always loving.  Ms.  Simones great care in creating these characters is evident.  This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so theres plenty of time to read this series before American King comes out.  This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!  Im done running from you I said honestly.  I tried and it didnt matteryou haunted me everywhere I went.  And you haunted me he murmured rolling over to press his lips against mine once more.  My little prince.  And so the next act in our tragedy began.,5,False
112, How did it come to this?  How did we get here?  How will it end?  What a perfect book to read during eclipse week !!  This taut and fastpaced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end.  And what an ending!  Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world.  It is an exciting exotic lifestyle hypnotic and mysterious all at once.  Then the darkness comes.  Without the countdown in the sky its pure and instant.  All the street lights in the town below come on so quickly its like sparks igniting.  Now in the darkness disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality.  But this time its different.  The book begins in  with Lauras point of view.  She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously.  Why?  The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book.  We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker Jamie.  The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail.  The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamies guilt or innocence.  Just remember: there are many sides to each story.  The moment you think about an act in terms of how you are already halfway to doing it.  We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to chase an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels.  He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born.  They live in fear that Beth the young woman who had been raped years before will find them again.  She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker but then became wildly unstable.  Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear off the grid so that she would never find them again.  This book was incredibly gripping and thoughtprovoking.  It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantlyresearched settings.  The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation?  Until that day Id been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial or he was calling the worlds bluff.  But now a third possibility was inescapable and one in which I was horrifically culpable.  What if Jamie was innocent?  This book was addictive and wildly surprising.  The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse.  With my husband and daughter away eclipse chasing while I was reading this book the subject matter was even more compelling!  With themes of loyalty guilt and devotion this book really did it for me.  I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!,5,False
113, Smart and sexy and delicious!  I devoured this one.  LOVE Ryder!!!  This is my second  Dark nights novella and I really like this concept.  Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far I have enjoyed the stories.  Although Sweet Rivalry is a standalone Ryder first appeared in Sweet Cheeks as Saylors brother.  This novella is a steamy sweet and fastpaced romance that you can devour in one sitting.  This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Brombergs steamy yet witty writing style.  Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project.  They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything.  But Ryder is determined to win this time.  Of course they have some major chemistry but business is business right?  Beard burn is a real thing.  And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some.   I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Brombergs books.  That is one of my favorites things about her writing.  No wallflowers here!  If you are looking for a fast sexy witty read with a guaranteed happy ending then Sweet Rivalry is just the ticket.  My one complaint?  That this story wasnt longer!  Maybe we will get a fulllength book about these two someday!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
114, . Stars!!  Romance lovers rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend Gabriel Dalton!  You cant fix me you know...  Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings.  People who are bullied shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love.  And shes done it again with Most of All You.  Gabriel and Crystals story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey.  He needed someone warm and caring.  Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts.  Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit.  I was not that girl...  This is in the end a totally swoony contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting.  The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person.  Although this is most definitely a love story the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystals new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story.  Books like this are why I read contemporary romance.  Passion honesty damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness  this book has it all.  I was spellbound caught once again in his gaze.  No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then not in all my life.  While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length there is enough revealed about both characters pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead.  Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book.  Choice is such a loaded word isnt it?  Choices though our own were so weighted down with all the things that had come before so stained with the messes of our past.  This is a slowburn romance but Gabriel and Crystals story is SO worth the wait!  Instalove would NOT have worked here and Im glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that oftenused trope.  Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers.  And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together.  I wasnt a victim.  I was a survivor...  Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers.  This is a heartfelt sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader.  There is not too much darkness I dont want to give too much away about the plot but just enough to add drama and tension to the story.  I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton!  The longer shed touched me the more a yearning rose in my soul so strong it took my breath.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
115, I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it.  Yes the plot is a little farfetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZYhot.  The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about.  Chase is well a hot cop.  Theres always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him.  A flock of them even.  In a place like Kansas hes the closest thing we have to a rock star.  Livia is a librarian who is approaching .  She wants children but not a relationship.  So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached.  Thats pretty much it.  What I liked about this story was the welldeveloped characters and the funny banter.  And the Kelley Trio  yes Officer Kelley!  Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gunshy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby!  Megan you never told me your brother was a hot.  Oh my God.  I didnt just say that.  But I totally did.  My face is heated with embarrassment.  A cop!  I meant a cop.  This is a fun sexy story with a very low angst factor.  If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours then this is the book for you!,3,False
116, No matter what happens even on your worst day find something to be grateful about.  Itll make you feel better.  What a gorgeous book!!  Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful it is almost painful.  But she also makes her characters seem real very human funny flawed and just very authentic.  Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it more heart.  She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two.  One person alone against winter was rough.  But two people together... Together.  A word I never used.  Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts.  They both cant seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment temporarily and just as roommates.  Slowly they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness.  This is a slowbuild romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters.  I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end.  It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is The Butterfly Project has it all.  The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together.  ...I realized you could get used to anythingeven being alone for years  right until the moment you touched something better than what you had.  A very sexy and emotional story The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books.  It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness.  And the extras in this book are absolutely fantastic!  All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story.  You are my home baby he said.  I never want to be anywhere else.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
117,  / Stars!  What a beautiful gripping and intense story!  I jumped into Prestons Honor without knowing too much about the plot.  There is so much to love about this book: secondchance love burning passion forgiveness and compassion.  Lia Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California.  Lias mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough.  Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her.  Nobody girl.  Nobody girl.  Nobody girl.  Me.  My heart!!  Both brothers loved Lia but through a series of events it is Cole who begins to date Lia.  Life happens Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town.  There are no opportunities for her to continue her education and she is resigned to accept her lot in life.  I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nations migrant farm workers.  Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother.  The only bright spot in her life is Preston.  She is overjoyed when he returns to town.  Bound together by a tragedy it is difficult to know whether their love will survive.  Annalia.  Christ.  Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful.  I gripped the hair at my forehead a sound of frustration coming up my throat.  Hadnt that always been the case?  Only this time .  this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart.  Id felt .  breathless.  Struck mute.  Consumed.  Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness?  Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them.  Lia was a lovely honest caring and gorgeous character inside and out and Preston was magnificent.  My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story!  I was desperate for these two to find happiness.  Thank you Preston.  For being my friend once for giving me my first dance for watching over me.  It was all I had.  It would have to be enough.  Once again Mia Sheridan does not disappoint.  I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances redemption and mercy.  And the Prologue was a stunner!!  Happy tears were flowing all around.  Or actually maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start.  Tonight.  This is our beginning Annalia.,5,False
118, I want to own every inch of your skin to be the only man who touches you who tastes you.  You think I wouldnt bid on a woman?  That I shouldnt bid on you of all people?  Ill spend every cent I have break every goddamn law to keep you.  The second book of the Endgame series begins right were The Pawn ended.  Avery has really hit rock bottom.  She is living in a rundown motel and has lost everything.  But she is determined to get back what is precious to her and The Knight is another deliciously dark romance that features some great characters and writing.  Gabriel really cares for Avery.  He is outwardly cruel but their scenes together are everything I love about Skye Warrens writing.  He was almost brutally cruel in the first book but here he seems to finally show his true feelings.  But Avery wants nothing more then to get revenge on the man she believes led to her fathers downfall.  Make no mistake Gabriel Miller is still a harsh and brutal figure and he still remains mysterious.  I love the supporting characters in this book and would love to read more about Averys mother!  The circumstances surrounding her death become more and more mysterious and I hope that the third book in this series tells more of her story.  The Knight ends on a surprising note and I cant wait to read The Castle the third book in this series.  Skye Warren once again delivers the goods in this story.  This series is dark very sensual and dangerous.  Highly recommend these books for all lovers of dark and sexy romance.,4,False
119, Some of the best times in life come from bad ideas.  Sometimes you need a good oldfashioned romance to lose yourself in and Egomaniac is just the book!  Vi Keeland once again shows her talent for writing a funny sexy tenderhearted romance that is creative engaging and sweet.  I enjoyed every minute of this book.  Emerie and Drew meet cute and I was drawn in from the very beginning.  What separates Vi Keelands romances from the rest of the books out there is the heated chemistry between her characters and their wonderful banter.  Emerie is new in town and winds up renting space from Drew an aggressive divorce attorney.  He is a commitmentphobe for very good reason.  I loved the way the author slowly revealed his history and I absolutely adored his POV!!  This book is literally laughoutloud funny.  And I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them.  Damn straight.  Im like a superhero.  The Prolactinator.  Egomaniac is a supersexy very fastpaced read that has lots of warmth and heart.  It is witty and smart and very addicting.  I loved all of the secondary characters and I hope that at least one of them is getting their own story soon!  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more stories from this very talented author.  Maybe just maybe neither one of us had found the right one before now...because we hadnt met each other yet.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
120, Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember.  This house might be simple but its ambition is extraordinary.  A fantastic psychological thriller that I could not put down!!  Would you be willing to give up almost all of your worldly possessions for a chance live in a stunning home for very little rent?  That is the fascinating premise of this book by JP Delaney a pseudonym for a wellknown writer.  I read that the author did not want to reveal his/her gender because the book is told from a female point of view.  I did not know this when I first read a sample and the author succeeded in making me feel as though I was inside the narrators minds.  The brilliant architect Edward Monkford has designed One Folgate Street in London a hightech house with cutting edge design.  Edward is a follower of minimalism to the extreme so much so that the tenants must agree to abide by his extreme decluttering rules and regulations.  But he sees his rules as so much more than control and firmly believes that a house really can change you from within.  If you have to declutter your life then you will begin to see what is truly important in life and you will free your mind to become a better person.  Emma and Jane are both looking for a fresh start.  They are required to fill out a stringent and lengthy application in order to pass on to the final level of approval which is a very brief meeting with the owner and designer of One Folgate Street.  The rent is low and the house is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood.  Edward is difficult mysterious brilliant moody...but the chance to live in the magnificent home is so tempting the women overlook all of this in order for a chance to live at One Folgate Street.  The home is equipped with the latest hightech gadgets and the tenants must answer periodic questionnaires in order to continue living in the house.  The evaluations test their ethics their physical wellbeing and their state of mind and are quite literally crucial to continues living in the house.  Thats all anyones looking for really isnt it?  Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?  The descriptions of the home are absolutely enthralling.  I am still thinking about this book weeks after finishing!  The idea of extreme decluttering is very thoughtprovoking and is woven inextricably into this intriguing story.  Is Edward as dangerous and unhinged as everyone seems to think he is?  This is a classic tale where NOTHING is as it seems.  I literally read this book over the course of  days and was shocked by the surprising conclusion.  The story is told from the point of view of Emma who is seeking a safe neighborhood and a secure home after a recent breakin and Jane who has suffered a tragic loss and is seeking a new beginning.  Their stories converge in a creative way and I loved how the author kept me guessing until the very last page.  The house literally plays a central role in this book and to me is one of the main characters in this story.  If you are looking for a thrilling read that will challenge you and your boundaries then The Girl Before is for you!!  I LOVED it and highly recommend it for all fans of domestic thrillers.

121, . Stars  Bombshell was not quite for me but was an engaging and verrrry sexy romance.  I adore C.D.  Reisss writing and I know that not every book is for every reader.  SO although I love her trademark staccatostyle of writing it just didnt work for me here.  This book seemed to be written more in the style of a screenplay which is fine but the rapid shifting between dialogue and settings was disorienting for me.  I didnt really connect with the MCs until late in the book and I wanted to feel a connection not only TO them but BETWEEN them.  And the nearconstant discussion of bodily functions was just very uninteresting to me.  Would this make a cute movie?  Absolutely.  It just didnt work for me as a romance novel.  The stereotyping of wealthy Hollywood insiders and the way they raise their children and constantly chase after their staff was also very uninteresting to me.  I did enjoy the latter half of the book and loved the way Brad grew as a person and as a new father to Nicole.  I am definitely in the minority on this book so by all means give this one a try if you love books about single dads and Hollywood superstars.  C.D.  Reiss continues to be one of my favorite romance authors and I will always read what this woman writes!  ARC provided by Montlake in return for an honest review.,4,False
122, . Stars  If you cant trust yourself who can you trust?  OMG!!  Intelligent and thrilling pageturner that I read in almost one sitting!  The rather abrupt ending was a little unsatisfying BUT the clever story kept me guessing.  I think most people do something or fail to take action that may cause some guilt.  Well this story begins with Cass taking a shortcut late at night and failing to stop and help a woman who is stopped on the side of the road.  The motorist ends up dead.  Cass feels guilty but just as significant are the little things she begins to forget...how to run the washing machine making dinner plans with friends and even rather significant purchases.  Her mother suffered from earlyonset Alzheimers.  What is happening to Cass?  Casss mental wellbeing soon spirals out of control and she fears she will suffer the same fate as her mother.  I literally could not put this book down!  I FELT Casss hysteria and fear.  The last part of the book was thrilling and surprising and gave me everything I love about thrillers.  I highly recommend this one for all fans of this genre and even if you want to step outside your usual genre.  Cass was a memorable heroine and I was cheering for her all throughout the book.  This is my first book by B.A.  Paris and she has now become one of my faves!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
123, .   Stars  I adore Jane HarveyBerrick and her books are among my favorites.  This story is a lovely sexy romance with a good dose of oldfashioned angst thrown in.  I liked the way the author exposed the horrific realities of dogfighting so kudos to her for that.  There was obviously lots of research that went into this book.  Also loved that the heroine was a veterinarian.  There is a good amount of steam in this book and the story makes for a wonderful afternoon or evening of reading.

124, Mack was the only one for me.  There was no way this feeling could ever be replicated...because it had been years in the making.  Penelope Ward is an autobuy author for me.  Hands down her secondchance romances are among my absolute favorite stories!  Her main characters always have tons of heart soul and chemistry And humor!  And I adore the catchy title of this book.  Mack is devoted to his young son Johan who he enrolled in Frankies class in Boston.  Mack has broken up with his sons mother with whom he had a longterm relationship.  Mack and Frankie were roommates years before with Frankie losing her heart completely to Mack.  But they were not meant to be and went their separate ways.  Now Mack has shown up determined to win Frankie back.  She is the love of his life.  The problem is that she now is living with her current boyfriend an older very stable college professor who adores her.  What will Frankie do?  Told in alternating POVs we read how Mack and Frankies love blossomed several years before.  They are simply meant to be.  Remember all those things you wished I could do to you?  Im about to make all your wishes come true if you let me.  All the moms in school pursue Mack who is the resident DILF.  Penelope Ward is seriously FUNNY and there are some hilarious moments in this book!  But at its heart it is a gorgeous secondchance romance as only Ms.  Ward can write.  Mack Daddy is SERIOUSLY sexy and sizzling hot.  I adored the supporting cast of characters and I fell in love with Macks son Jonah.  I also adored Frankies boyfriend and felt very sad when she had to make her choice between Mack the love of her life and her current boyfriend.  Ms.  Ward handles this situation with grace and sensitivity.  This book is warm and sweet and sexy all at once.  Overall a lovely emotional and sexxxxxy story with lots of heat and heart!  I lost all those years only to end up in the same place wanting you and wishing I hadnt ever let you go.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
125, CD Reiss is one of my favorite romance authors.  Her writing is mature sexy nuanced and never fails to grab me.  And I do love books about marriage.  Separation Games was a perfect conclusion to the first book in this series.  Marriage Games ended with an unusual twist and I absolutely loved how the author worked things out between Adam and Diana.  I feel both of their pain confusion and longing.  And Adam OMG!  He was one of the authors most memorable heroes.  Wow.  Both Diana and Adam are mature smart and very driven.  This book is offthecharts sexy and is the perfect read for fans of mature contemporary romance with an erotic twist.  Beg to come.  Please.  Beg harder.  Adam and Diana do not have a easy path but when they do finally resolve their issues it is explosive.  I have never read a book by CD Reiss that I didnt love and this duet is no exception.  The supporting characters are all very wellwritten and the New York City setting adds another exciting layer to the story.  The Epilogue is fantastic!  I was actually sorry to see this story end.  Highly recommend this steamy emotional and very mature erotic romance.  Your problem isnt that you dont love.  Your problem is you love so much it scares you.

127, This book started off as something else and then turned into a very adult very erotic very explicit romance that I really fell for.  The first part of the book begins in college with Sabrina falling for the bad boy Donovan.  I will admit that the beginning of this book which was released as a separate novella did not really hold my interest.  But when the book fastforwards  years and Sabrina has moved to New York WOW!!  The Laurelin Paige that I know and love returned with a bang.  Sabrina is hired to work at the company run by Donovan and Weston.  She is smart driven and extremely competent.  But yet she is still in many ways the insecure college student who felt out of her league with wealthy men like Donovan and Weston.  This book is EXTREMELY explicit and explores the taboo subject of rape fantasies.  So if that is not your thing then you will not like this story.  But if you are a fan of rollercoaster emotions then you will love this book.  Sabrina has always been obsessed with Donovan.  But he is distant cold sarcastic.  She and Weston have a fling but she realizes that she still has deep feelings for Donovan and cannot resist his allure.  I dont want you to touch me like Weston I said once and for all.  I dont want Weston!  I want you!  Donovan let loose the smallest hint of a smile.  I know.  I was waiting for you to know too.  Sabrina goes back and forth with her feelings for Donovan.  He was downright cold to her BUT he is so hot she cannot stay away.  I felt that this book really picked up around the  mark and I would urge everyone to give this thrilling and extremely sexy story a try.  Why the  stars?  I loved the absolutely electrifying chemistry between Sabrina and Donovan.  The sexy times are off the charts.  I did not love Sabrinas lack of selfesteem and her feelings of worthlessness.  I hope in the next book she goes after what she wants.  I found this book to be very engrossing surprising and very very adult.  So that for me is a win.  I love these kind of books where the hero is damaged and unloveable yet becomes obsessed with the heroine.  I hope we get Donovans POV in the next book and I cannot wait for the conclusion to Sabrina and Donovans story!  Were you even going to say goodbye?  I asked pretending to balance accusation with acceptance when really I was hoping hed say hed changed his mind about going at all.  He smiled lazily.  I dont know what you mean.  Im still here.  Youre just as much already gone.  His face was in the shadows but I could feel his expression sober even if I couldnt see it.  Im less gone than youd imagine.

128, .   Stars!  Just like I tell the boys we dont play for one single run we play to win the whole game.  And Im in it to win it.  Mariana Zapata where have you been all my life!?  Wait for It was completely engrossing a slowburn romance that really ignited my passion for reading again.  And now I must decide which one of her books to read next!  This was my first book by this amazing author and I absolutely adored every single word of this incredible story!  Wait for It is not a predictable story.  It is a solid real passionate romance filled with heart and humor and heartstopping love.  Diana is single and raising two young boys.  She is independent funny hardworking and definitely NOT looking for romance.  She meets her new neighbor Dallas in a very unconventional way and they actually get off to a very rocky start.  Dallas is stern uptight and seems to not like Diana very much AT ALL.  What were you supposed to do when someone didnt want to be your friend or at least be friendly and youd tried your best?  I thought Id been a pretty good person.  A pretty good neighbor.  I hadnt done anything to make him feel uncomfortable.  At least I genuinely didnt think I had.  Diana ohsoslowly begins to realize what kind of man Dallas really is when he becomes the coach of her young boys baseball team.  Between baseball and being neighbors Dallas begins to form a bond with Diana and her family that biomes the real backbone of this story.  He has a soft spot for single moms.  You are no one special Diana I reminded myself.  You are no one special.  Mariana Zapatas writing is so unique and fresh that I am going to pick up one of her other books next.  I could not get enough of Dallas and Diana!  The dialogue was snappy and felt SO real.  The character development was strong and the romance unfolded perfectly.  No instalove here folks.  This couple built a solid foundation so that when they eventually got together it was simply beautiful.  Wait for It was the kind of book that I simply could not wait to get back to.  Isnt that the best kind of story?  If you are looking for a passionate story about two grownups who have lived and loved and lost then pick up this book.  It is gorgeous.  She wouldnt be my first but shed be the only one who ever mattered.  I think she could wait for the time to be right.  Id make sure she never regretted it.,5,False
129, This story had so much promise!  And I love Whitney G.  s writing style in fact Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year.  This was a cute fast read BUT several typos later and a heroine who sends sexually explicit emails from her work account and Im out.  Moving on with high hopes for this authors next book.  Call me an eternal optimist.,3,False
130, Love the Reapers books so I was excited to read this when it released as part of the  Dark Nights series.  Joanna Wyldes writing is smart funny and sexy.  I love how Shade goes after Mandy but only claims her when hes sure shes in it all the way.  Mandys had her eye on Shade but didnt make a move because she already had a boyfriend who was a total loser.  When I first met Rebel Id teased him about having a crush on Shade because my new boyfriend couldnt stop talking about the man.  Then Id met Shade in person.  Now I got it.  Rebel worked hard to make sure everyone knew he was a big bad biker.  Shade didnt have to work at it.  He just was big and bad.  Joanna Wyldes MC books are among my favorite stories and this story reminded me why I love her so much.  Her women are strong resilient and tough as nails.  Not to mention downtoearth and selfdeprecating.  Mandy cant resist the allure of Shade the President of the Reapers MC even though she is conned into being alone with him for the first time.  He was the biggest nastiest bastard in the roomnot to mention easy on the eyesand deep down inside I just knew wed make beautiful babies together.  Too bad I already sort of had a boyfriend... Shade was so potent wed probably have quintuplets or something crazy on the first try.  You dont even want a baby I reminded my quivering ovaries.  Jump him!  Jump him and ride him like a cowgirl!  they snapped back.  Just think how sexy and strong he is.  His sperm could kick Rebels ass and you know it!  Shade is NOT looking for an old lady or even anything more than a one night stand.  He makes this very clear to Mandy.  Which is fine with her because she has had nothing but rotten luck with her previous boyfriends.  Girls wanted flowers and roses and forever.  I wanted the road under my tires and something new on the horizon.  Never understood why so many of my brothers were willing to settle down in one place.  I wasnt that guy.  Never had been.  Never would be.  Theres lots of action and lots of steamy dirty scenes and just lots of fun in this story.  I adore Joanna Wylde and this story satisfied my craving for her MC stories.  Loved visiting with the Reapers MC again.  Shades Lady was a witty funny sexy and fast read.  Highly recommend for all fans of MC romance.  Id never been much of a believer but in that moment I saw Heaven and it was glorious.,4,False
131, Holy hotness Batman!  So much to love about this book!!  And some things not so much!  But overall Hail Mary was a deliciously naughty sports romance with some unforgettable passion between the main characters.  Nicola Rendell is definitely a writer to watch and her book kept me engaged and laughing until the very end.  This is a dirty dirty book and LOTS of fun.  Even if you dont usually read sports romance give Hail Mary a try!  You will love this very spicy and very funny story.  I loved that Jimmy and Mary were mature adults with families jobs friends and very full lives.  Jimmy had a sweet side and Mary was absolutely lovable and perfectly relatable.  Yes there is a touch if instalove but it worked perfectly in this story.  And the Chicago setting was fantastic.  Hail Mary was a wellwritten engaging romantic and hilarious story with maybe THE sexiest scene I have read this year.  There I said it.  Hello champagne bottle!  Fans self I truly loved this book and love this authors fresh writing style.  What detracted from the story for me was the unprotected sex when Jimmy and Mary hardly knew each other sorry a big turnoff for me.  I also found it a little unbelievable that Mary had no clue who Jimmy was when they both lived in the same city where he was a famous football star.  But other readers didnt seem to mind so read this little gem of a story and judge for yourself!  Its got plenty of heat and humor to please even the most jaded romance reader.  I cant wait to see whats coming up next for this wonderful new author!  Yeah?  You think so?  You think you can handle me?  Her eyes widen a little.  I think so she whispers.  Then I let her slip from my arms such a fucking shame but Im not about to let her open her own door.  As she gets into the cabon the street side the safe sideI say into her ear Well just see about that.,4,False

A very fastpaced and supersexy story Womanizer takes place in Chicago and follows Olivia a young intern at a hugely successful company owned by Callan Carmichael.

133, Sometimes you come across a rainbow storyone that spans your heart.  You might not be able to grasp it or hold on to it but you can never be sorry for the color and magic it brought.  What a beautiful journey!  Mists of the Serengeti is a lush story set against the harsh reality of the wilds of Africa.  Ro and Jack are brought together by a terrible tragedy.  Jack has been left bitter and empty Ro is griefstricken but still has the ability to laugh and relate to other human beings.  I will admit I was a little reluctant to dive into this story knowing it begins with a horrible event but I was immediately and completely captivated by these characters.  I caught a glimpse of his soul.  So many pieces of him had been fed to the lions.  And as dark and bitter as it had turned him he was a gladiator for standing where I would have surely fallen.  The African backdrop is almost like another character in this book  harsh stunning and dangerous.  The descriptions of the land its inhabitants and its wildlife are magical.  I was literally lost in the pages of this story!  Leylah Attar remains one of my favorite writers and I have devoured everything she has written.  Mists of the Serengeti is a gorgeous and uplifting story filled with romance love life and tears.  Dont miss it!  My greatest loss had led to my greatest love.  Hearts were broken and hearts were healed.  Lives were lost and lives were saved.,5,False
134,  STARS!  An intelligent twisty psychological thriller that kept me up all night!  Ill try not to reveal too much about the plot because it is a shocker!  Zoe is a stunning Manhattan socialite living in a world of charity dinners beautiful apartments and gorgeous vacation homes.  She has everything she could want at her fingertips: a designer wardrobe a private cook and romantic getaways with her perfect husband Henry.  I stop protesting his indulgence when he buys me clothing and shoes and jewelry.  I stop looking for the catch.  There doesnt seem to be one.  So what do you do?  But right from the beginning there are cracks in Zoes perfect life and we dont know whether it is from her damaged past or from someone or something in her current life.  She is growing bored as Henrys wife and longs for her younger self when she had a job friends and freedom to do whatever she wanted.  She begins to chafe in her perfect little bubble.  I can prepare dinner and I have on occasion but he always insists we ask Penny which irritates me.  I have all day in this echoing apartment my own voice bouncing off the sterile bare walls and marble floors.  Sometimes I wonder if uselessness can kill a person.  Zoe is witty sarcastic and smart and all of the characters were engaging and interesting.  I loved her connection with Henry and even though she was in love with him she never quite felt that she really knew him at all.  Henry is a product of a traditional household and paternalism runs deep in his veins which I find both charming and a little infuriating depending on the day.  But is Zoe just imagining things where they do not exist?  Henry is the perfect husband and all he wants to do is please her.  The author did a great job at creating characters I really cared about.  With all his odd mannerisms Henry seems to be in love with his wife and do everything for her.  After a charity event Zoe begins to question her past and seeks out certain people that she had thought were long gone from her life.  I dont want to give anything away because this book is full of surprises and fantastic twists and turns.  I absolutely loved Zoes slow awakening from a bored housewife to a woman with a purpose.  The author kept me guessing for the whole book!  The Vanishing Year has been called a domestic thriller.  This is a perfect description.  It is an edgy sexy exciting story that kept me guessing until the very end.  The little clues sprinkled here and there the red herrings the gorgeous Henry all added up to the perfect thriller for me!  Dont miss this one.  I cant wait to read more books by the amazing Kate Moretti.  Favorite quote:  It wasnt that long ago that I found this sort of convenient arrangement of our lives to be charming like a party card trick.  A sleight of hand here a simple misdirection there and Voila heres your dinner.  Now it crawls under my skin and festers there like a chigger and the whole thing makes me itch.

I wished she wouldve mentioned how much the learning was going to hurt.  I was enthralled by this deeply moving thriller!  The smalltown atmosphere is perfectly captured by the author.  Every characters is flawed some more so than others.  I never saw the ending coming.  This book was fastpaced smart and engaging.  Dont be put off by the endless comparisons to other bestsellers in this genre.  Everything You Want Me to Be stands on its own as a poignant and suspenseful story.

He runs the beast through with a sword and then retraces his steps using the string thus saving all the sacrifices that year and in the future.  Ive reached the center of the maze.

137, If you need some light and frothy romance in your life then you will love Emma Chases latest story and her very funny very male POV.

Have I told you how hot it is when you roll out the royal facts?  Royally Screwed is a very charming fairytale with a healthy does of Emma Chases trademark spicy humor.

What I enjoyed about this book was the witty sexy fastpaced dialogue and the engaging supporting characters.  Theres also a wonderful theme of family and duty running through this story that I really loved.  The author has created a very relatable fairytale that provided an escape from real life.  The ending was a lovely surprise and along with Nicholas and Olivia I adored his brother Henry.  I cant wait to read his story!  She looks into my eyes and Im lost.  Wrecked.  Owned.  Theres no thought no desireexcept to please her.  Make her see stars and touch heaven.,4,False
138, Katy Evans has created another sweet AND swoony hero!  I read this hot romance between Matt and Charlotte in one siting.  Mr.  President is a feelgood story set against the exciting backdrop of Americas capitol.  With the U.S.  election season almost at an end we all can use a good oldfashioned political romance!  Matt and Charlotte were both born into political families.  Charlotte is the daughter of a senator and Matt is the son of a former U.S.  president.  Their futures seem predestined.  But Charlotte is not sure what she wants to do with her life until a promise she made as a child now comes back to life.  She had promised Matt that if he ever ran for president that she would join his campaign.  Now fastforward to the present day and a young and very promising Matt is running for president as an independent candidate.  He is very passionate about changing the world.  Charlotte who worked for her mothers organization assisting women in need is totally captivated by him and cant hep but be mesmerized by him.  This is a political campaign so Matts every move is being watched.  Charlotte is a campaign staffer.  Will they ever be able to go public with their very passionate romance?  I loved that this book had a very upbeat and positive spin on American politics.  Ms.  Evans seems to have really done her homework on the inner workings of political campaigns and it really shows.  Matt and Charlotte had amazing chemistry together even though this story was a slowburn romance.  It does conclude on a bit of a cliffhanger but the next book in the series will be releasing very soon in January .  I cant wait to see how Matt and Charlottes romance plays out.  Were a perfect couple in the most imperfect situation.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
139, Well.  I was prepared to love this book.  Even the clever cover grabbed my attention.  While I deeply cared about the MCs some parts of the book were a bit too slow for me and the endings felt rushed.  So I really liked this book a lot.  I loved the creative and clever plot and was totally taken by surprise by the conclusion.  I never saw that coming!  I felt the deep connection between the MCs and it just felt right.  It seems that no one cared much for Mia so much so that no one was sure she was actually missing as opposed to just being irresponsible.  Cold her kidnapper actually saves her life by hiding her away once he realizes that she will be useless to his boss once a ransom is collected.  There is much more to the story: there is the sad tale of James and Eves marriage the fathers coldness toward Mia for most of her life and the superstar sister who outshines Mia at every turn.  The only one who seems to really care about her is her captor.  Lots of readers didnt like the jumping back and forth in time in the narration but I felt it added a sense of disorientation which was necessary in the book.  All in all a sturdy thriller hat kept me turning the pages all night.  I cannot believe The Good Girl is the first book by Mary Kubica!  I cannot wait to read her other books!,4,False
140, Youre the best mistake Ive ever made.  Four Letter Word clever title no?  was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeplyfelt emotion.  Brian and Sidneys story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying!  Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way.  Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls BUT it really worked for me!  Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins so she will she ever learn to trust another man again?  Even one as perfect as Brian Savage?  I needed you but I didnt know I needed you until you reached out to me.  As with all of J. Daniels books the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very real.  They have regular jobs very good friends and and just came across as very downtoearth.  The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything!  Brian was a fantastic sexy dirtytalking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side.  He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work.  I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney.  He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney!  She couldnt know too much.  She could never know.  Never.  I gave her enough so I could still have her but I took everything.  Four Letter Word was a wonderfully paced and steamy story perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance.  J. Daniels is one of my goto romance authors and she really delivered with Brian and Sidneys story.  I cannot wait for more stories in this series!  Love was a risk.  It was wild and unpredictable.  You could either hold on for the ride not knowing how it would end or you could let go and never know the amazing you couldve had.

141, .   STARS  Today would be different.  Tomorrow would be different.  Forever would be different.  She could fight me all she wanted.  She could vent and freak the fuck out to whoever she was on the phone with.  But when I hit the bottom stair I would not be leaving.  Ever.  While this book was very readable and had a fastpaced plot and interesting characters it just didnt quite do it for me.  I am in the minority on this one so read Retrieval for yourself and you might love it!  I loved the scenes between Roman and Elisabeth and yes they absolutely belong together!  Their lives are intertwined with Walt and Clare.  I adored Romans sexy uberalpha ways.  BUT there were too many inconsistencies in the story for me.  The ending felt a bit rushed and I would have liked to have have spent more time with the main characters before the book ended.  For example during their separation Roman sent Elisabeth huge company checks for several hundred thousand dollars.  You cant just write a check like that without accounting for it on a balance sheet or an accrual.  Its not like writing a personal check!  And she never cashed them which would also raise some accounting red flags.  But okay.  The catchy plot will definitely please most readers and Roman and Elisabeth are something special.  The book ends very abruptly and the second book with be about Clare and another character from Retrieval.  Overall this was a fast and mostly enjoyable book.,4,True
142, WOW!!  An intense sexy and VERY suspenseful romantic thriller with an edge.  Lucas is one of the authors most memorable characters ever.  I wish she knew how much I want to be normal for her.  Read the book description and then dive in to this fastpaced and dramatic story.  I really dont want to go into too much detail because spoilerfree is the way to go with this one!  Fans of J.B.  Salsbury know that she always creates THE most sensitive damaged and protective heroes but trust me Lucas is VERY different from all her other characters.  Lucas is trying to live a quiet and uneventful life having lived through a terrible trauma.  His daily struggles are painful and feel very real.  Told in alternating POVs the book also tells Shyanns story.  She has come back home not exactly willingly in order to start over again while working for her dad.  Split is not what youd expect from J.B.  Salsbury but it is a wonderfully sensitive and VERY sexy story.  With tons of suspense!  Lucas is a beautifully damaged soul who deserves a happily ever after.  The ending surprised me but it was absolutely perfect for these characters!  I LOVED Ms.  Salsburys venture into romantic suspense and cant wait to read more stories like Split.  With thanks to the author for providing an ARC in return for an honest review.,4,False
143, . Stars!  Take the hoodie off.  Please.  Ill only look with my eyes.  OMG this book was SO funny!!  Sweet and sugary but sexy and romantic too.  I devoured this confection of a story.  I am absolutely floored that this was a debut novel!  Every line was funnier than the one before.  And the story was pure enjoyment!  This book was the perfect antidote for me.  Lucy and Josh are coworkers at a large publishing company who end up competing for the same job.  I am very picky about office romances because a I work in an office and b they are usually so unrealistic and overly simple.  Not The Hating Game.  The author nails the workplace setting perfectly.  Lucy and Josh HATE each other.  Like they cant even stand to be in the same room together.  But they share an office!  They are complete opposites in every way.  He is cold and controlling she is warm and friendly.  He is REALLY tall she is VERY petite.  They tease each other incessantly.  Stop calling me Shortcake.  Watching you pretend to hate that nickname is the best part of my day.  The writing in this book was absolutely hilarious.  The dialogue was fresh and original.  I dont like big guys.  Theyre too much like horses.  They could trample you if you got underfoot.  He is auditing my appearance with the same narrowed eyes that I am.  I wonder what the top of my head looks like.  Im sure he only fornicates with Amazons.  Lucy and Josh eventually end of competing for the same job which would mean a huge promotion for both of them.  Lucy comes to realize that their mutual and VERY public dislike for each other just might actually be mutual lust.  She cant help but drool over Joshs perfection every single day.  Today is a magnificent black Tshirt day.  Write today in your diaries.  Tell your grandchildren stories about it.  I tear my eyes away but they slide back moments later.  Underneath that Tshirt is a body that could fog an elderly librarians glasses.  This book reminded me of Tangled by Emma Chase.  The writing is smart sexy funny and very sharp.  Both characters here are fully developed and the secondary characters are just as interesting!  I fell in love with both Lucys and Joshs families.  AND I loved the characters growth over the course of the book.  Ive got so much inside me I have no idea about.  Im like the mayor of a city Ive never seen.  I highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for a sweet and sexy modern romance with the perfect amount of wit and sarcasm.  In the dark I slide my body against his feeling his sighs and I tug him down to lie on me properly.  Im pretty heavy.  Ill flatten you.  Ive had a good life.,4,False
144, I read this sweet and warm romance in one sitting.  Not too much angst but plenty of steam and heart to satisfy every fan of contemporary romance.  The story revolved around a sexy pilot Carter who embarks on a romantic and unplanned adventure with Kendall a girl who is running from her future.  Playboy Pilot is a fastpaced glamorous story that takes the reader to places around the world.  It is a bit of escapist fantasy that is grounded in reality but is very funny sexy and enjoyable.  Kendall and Carter meet in an airport when she is trying to decide what to do with the rest of her life.  Carter is sexy as hell a gorgeous pilot and right then Kendall makes a rash decision that will change her life.  Yes Carter has had a wild past but he is completely honest with Kendall and does not try to hide his past.  This is ultimately a very sweet romance filled with lots of heart written in the style that I love by these two authors.  You can always count on a happy ending for the MCs in Penelope and Vis books even if their path is not so smooth getting there.  Enjoy!  All good things must come to an end right?  Except our ending was one I didnt see coming.,4,False
145, What a perfect ending to a fantastic series!  Beautiful is a delicious dizzying sexy funny and poignant story.  Beautiful Bastard was one of my earliest fanfic favorites and while I am sad that this series is ending I thoroughly enjoyed this yummy story.  This is a lighthearted upbeat and sexy book that delivers on all fronts.  As with the earlier books all of the characters are interconnected.  Jensen is Hannas bother and Pippa is Rubys friend.  They meet in the most adorable way on an international flight but of course neither one knows the who the other is.  They meet up again and of course sparks fly.  These two could not be more opposite: Pippa is breaking free from her old life and is living in the moment for the first time in her life and Jensen is a complete workaholic.  But opposites attract right?  So while on a road trip Pippa and Jensen start a wild fling.  Your hair like this makes your eyes bluer he continued and my mind hit the brakes.  Makes your lips pinker.  Makes you look too perfect to be real.  This is a fastpaced and endearing romantic comedy with an absolutely perfect Epilogue.  I loved seeing the whole gang reunited again and enjoyed every minute of this book.  Jensen and Pippa were fabulous together and the ending was exactly what I hoped for!  Its too bad Im too eccentric for you.  Its too bad youre too busy for me.  Its too bad Im only learning my heart and you have yours rolled in bubble wrap.

146, .   Stars  I ADORE Renee Carlino and I think that all of her other books are beautifully written.  Not in This Life is one my top favorite books!  Lucian Divine did not have the depth that I expect from this writers work.  There was plenty of tell but not enough show.  This lack of detail led to me not really feeling the bond between the main characters.  Without spoiling the plot there are just too many open questions in this book.  The ending felt rushed.  There are elements of romance sex and even humor here but I never felt the love between Evey and Lucian.  I like that the author wrote a story that is certainly different and unexpected.  Some readers may enjoy this type of book but it was just not for me.  I loved the Epilogue and the ending for these characters was perfect.  Definitely try this one and judge for yourself!

147, . Stars!  One of Alessandra Torres best books.  Couldnt put it down!!  Crisp concise fastpaced and enthralling.  All of the ingredients for a great read!  If you lie enough times no one believes your truth.  This book is Alessandra Torre at her best: nononsense smart and engaging fiction.  Helena is a very unlikely heroine prickly moody and basically angry at the world.  She doesnt want to rely on anyone at all.  She even keeps her longtime agent Kate at arms length.  On rare days Kate regrets ever meeting the woman.  But on most days she just wonders about her.  They say all geniuses are a little mad.  Maybe Helenas madness just took longer to come out.  But Helena as a story to tell and she doesnt have much time to do it.  She sets her sights on one writer and one writer only to become her ghostwriter.  A competing romance author Marka writes books that Helena actually despises.  But she sees a talent there that would be perfect for her own story.  Whats happened to me?  I have a story that I dont have time to tell.  I have an empty house that reeks of death.  I have no friends no family and no one to ask for help.  Im dying and its the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.  Alessandra Torre builds the suspense perfectly in this book all while holding the readers attention and slowly revealing the terrible secret about Helenas life.  This book is also a fascinating glimpse into the lonely life of a writer and the almost obsessive need to get the words out at all costs.  You can tell them who you are or what your job in the book was.  I dont mind if they know Ive had help.  They.  The gods in their world the eyes on which the axis rotated.  The readers.  The critics.  What would they think?  This is most definitely not a romance but the main characters are both renowned romance writers.  Helenas own story begins as a romance but you just know it is NOT going to conclude with a happily ever after.  Boys like him dont go for girls like me they dont follow me with their eyes or listen when I speak.  They dont lean closer or want more.  I absolutely loved this book.  Once I started I could not put it down.  I applaud the author for creating a heroine who is far from loveable yet completely and utterly captivating.  No question that astute readers will figure out the terrible secret before the surprising conclusion but this book is a total winner nonetheless.  It is completely original and inventive.  I have never read anything like it.  Alessandra Torre deserves all the accolades for this one!  Soon ... my final story will come out and everyone will know the truth.

148, Mindbending and completely unique take a chance and read this book!!  This fastpaced twisty sciencefiction thriller was just what I needed to get out of a reading slump!  Even if you dont usually read this genre DONT MISS DARK MATTER!  It is a brilliant romantic suspense story that had me guessing until the very end.  There IS a romance at the heart of this story of scientist/professor Jason Dessen because to me the struggle to get back to his beloved wife is what drives most of the action in this book.  I went back and reread the first chapter of this book after I finished to get a better picture of the sudden and violent kidnapping that occurs at the very beginning of this book.  My life is great.  Its just not exceptional.  And there was a time when it could have been.  You killed your ambition didnt you?  It died of natural causes.  Of neglect.  Jason is literally snatched from his current life and ends up in a place that might be a dream.  He cant tell the difference between reallife and fantasy until it slowly starts to dawn on him what is really happening to him.  The author made me feel sad nostalgic and thrilled all at once.  Plus there is an ethical dilemma at the heart of this story.  I feel insanity stalking me again threatening to curl me up fetal and shatter me into a million pieces.  Dark Matter is best read without knowing any spoilers.  AND I was thrilled to learn that it is going to be made into a movie!!  YES!!  Paging Viggo Mortensen or Michael Fassbender!  This story literally had me on the edge of seat the entire time I was reading.  Just when I thought I had things figured out I was surprised and thrilled by the next turn of events.  Part philosophy about what might have been part romance and all suspense Dark Matter is a book I wont soon forget.  Its the beautiful thing about youth.  Theres a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made no paths committed to and the road forking out ahead is pure unlimited potential.

151, Come back to me Georgia.  The first book in the new Brooklyn Bruisers series was a total delight!  ROOKIE MOVER has everything I love about Sarina Bowens books: great writing smart women fine and sexxxy hockey players and sweet sweet first love.  Georgia and Leo have been apart for years after having been in love when they were in high school.  Now Leo is the new trade for the Brooklyn Bruisers hockey team where his former girlfriend is also working.  Leo has never gotten over Georgia and even though she was the one who broke up with Leo she has never gotten over him either.  She has followed his career and now is face to face again with her one true love.  Ah Leo.  Georgias happiness was all he ever cared about.  His past with Georgia might keep him from reaching his full potential with the team but he will never betray her secrets.  He is a sexy sweet talented hockey player who brings just the right amount of steam and sweetness to this book.  Its obvious these two still care for each other and their chemistry still burns bright after all these years have passed.  So fucking good ...  Now give me that mouth.  Sarina Bowen writes some of THE best sports romances around.  There are great supporting characters in this book and Im thrilled that the next book will be ODouls story.  ROOKIE MOVE is a fantastic start to the new Brooklyn Bruisers series!  Highly recommended for all fans of sweet steamy secondchance romances.  You and I dont have onenight stands.

152, . Stars  I LOVED the premise of this book: a female motorcycle racer named Kenzie who races professionally.  Her father was a legendary racer and Kenzie is trying to carry on the family name.  The racing scenes are fascinating and the story is very fastpaced.  The author gives us an intimate behindthescenes look into the highly competitive world of motorcycle racing.  Racing is literally in Kenzies blood.  She is under tremendous pressure to succeed and her father is not her biggest fan.  Hayden races for a competitor and he is strictly offlimits to Kenzie.  She is downright mean to him at first and they have a lovehate thing going on that was very intense.  Kenzie has a lot of preconceived notions about Hayden which of course turn out to be completely wrong.  Hayden is sexonwheels and he and Kenzie begin a RomeoandJuliet romance that must be kept hidden from everyone.  Hayden is also an incredibly talented racer and Kenzie realizes she can learn a lot from him.  They both actually race better when they are competing against each other.  I absolutely love that the author created a female racer who is smart strong and competitive in a traditionally male sport.  Hayden is a DREAM and their scenes together are beautiful sexxxxy and very believable.  Overall I really liked this book it is a nice beach or poolside read and although some readers are not happy with the ending I loved it!!  There will definitely be more books to come in this series and the next one sounds like it will be verrrry interesting!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
153, Cheers she says raising her tumbler.  To remembering.  Frank clinks his glass against hers and he smiles.  And to you he says.  For being so generous.  Oh she says.  I dont know about generous.  Stupid more like.  Maybe both he says.  Yeah.  Ill go with that.  Story of my life.  Generous and stupid.  OMG!!!  I did not want this book to end!!  What a pageturner.  Moody evocative and thrilling Lisa Jewells writing surprised and enthralled me from beginning to end.  This book begins with Alice a frazzled single mother living in a tiny seaside town in England finding a man lost and alone and with no memory of how he came to be sitting on the beach in the driving rain.  Alice is funny warm witty and has not made the best choices in her life.  In fact her love life stinks so she is very wary of men in general.  But something calls to her about this lost and confused man and she brings him back to her cottage to recuperate in her guest house.  How long have you been sitting out here?  I got here yesterday.  Where did you come from?  I have no idea.  This brilliant story is told from multiple POVs spanning several decades.  At the same time that Alice finds Frank her nickname for the seemingly lovely man struggling with his memory loss a young bride in London named Lily realizes her new husband has suddenly vanished.  She is new to England and does not know anyone at all.  The mystery of her missing newlywed husband is one of the driving forces of this gem of a book.  There are tons of twists and surprises in store for the reader.  We do not know how the characters in this story are connected... or even if they are connected at all.  Flashing back decades before young Gray and Kirsty are on holiday with their parents.  Their fascinating story involves a local man who becomes interested in Kirsty.  Their stories rocket towards a stunning conclusion with Alice Frank and Lily.  To say that I could not put this book down is an understatement!  From the bustling London setting to the small seaside resort town I Found You sets the bar for romantic suspense books this year.  Long after finishing this book I still cant stop thinking about the characters.  Lisa Jewell is a new favorite author of mine.  This was my first book by her and now I cannot wait to get to her other titles.  Alice was completely relatable even when she didnt make the wisest of choices.  I cant recommend this book highly enough!  I loved every word.  ARC provided via NetGalley.,5,False
154, . Stars  The Protector is a perfectly enjoyable sexy fastpaced story.  While it perhaps did not live up to JEMs superb storytelling potential it was nonetheless am interesting and supersexy story.  I loved how the author presented another side to the heroine Camille: to the world she is a rich spoiled socialite.  But she is actually smart and very ambitious and determined to build her own business from the ground up.  She made lots of mistakes in the past and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now.  Jake is PURE Alpha a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD.  Camille does not want his protection AT ALL but her father hires Jake to make sure that Camille is safe.  Jake is also haunted by his own personal demons but sees his job with Camille as a chance at redemption.  JEM remains one of my autobuy authors.  Her This Man series is without question among my top favorite books of all time!  And I absolutely fell in love with Miller in the One Night series another series that I HIGHLY recommend.  Both Jesse and Miller are uberAlphas beyond compare.  So I thought The Protector had lots of sizzling sex scenes and very fastpaced action along with a mystery story as well.  While this is not my favorite JEM story definitely give the one a try if you love this kind of contemporary romance!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,3,False
155, .   Stars  Written in an unusually quirky style Professed is a student/teacher romance about Ben a college professor and yearold Naomi.  I will admit that it took me some time to get into this story but once I did I was engrossed in this very hot and at times very funny taboo romance.  First heed the warnings about this book and be aware that this story is VERY explicit!  Ben and Naomi meet at a secret masked ball and immediately begin a passionate affair.  Dr.  Ben Beck is a philosophy professor who has written a book and has been invited to join the faculty at Yale.  He has always questioned the existence of love and now ironically now finds himself head over heels in love with the smart and beautiful Naomi.  Once they become aware that Naomi is Bens student they are acutely aware of the risks they are taking.  Naomi could lose her place at Yale andBen could lose his position on the faculty at the very least.  But this is actually a very fastpaced book and the authors brisk writing style and sense of humor make this a very readable story.  Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.  There are lots of things I loved about this book and some not so much.  I loved reading about Naomis background and her family: she was raised by her father a lobsterman in a New England town and she struggles to pay her way through college and to fit in at Yale.  I would have loved to read more about Bens background!  The book is told in alternating POVs and the humor and brisk writing style lightens up the very explicit scenes.  Naomis character was unusually mature for her age.  Although I did not have an issue with the age gap I was not totally convinced what a yearold would find so alluring and compelling about a college junior.  I would have also loved to have known more about the secret society masked ball where Naomi and Ben first met.  I loved Naomis best friend Lucy and I know her story will be hilarious!  This is certainly not your average studentteacher forbidden romance and for that I applaud the author.  Overall Professed is a very sexy very enjoyable and promising debut story.

156, I adore Alexa Riley I really do!  Their short stories are my notsosecret addiction.  I think Ive bought every one of them!  Mechanic is one of my favorites.  So I was very excited to read their first fulllength book.  Unfortunately this story just didnt do it for me.  The overlypossessive controlling and bossy hero didnt even bother me at all in fact hes a part of this writing duos charm!  Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her.  What bothered me was that the heroine was a Yale grad but she sure didnt act like one.  In addition I had several issues with the plot which sadly interfered with my enjoyment of the story.  And when did Nordstrom come to Manhattan?  Answer: it didnt.  Nordstrom Rack doesnt count.  Ill continue to buy and read Alexa Rileys books but this one was a miss for me.,3,False
157, I love you all the way.  This is an EPIC story that was simply unputdownable filled with characters that I will never ever forget.  The writing is outstanding!  Nothing I can say in a review will do any justice to this gem but I will try.  Certainly not a story for everyone the book is at its heart a love story and what can happen when two human beings really truly deeply love each other and care for each other.  Wavy and Kellen meet when she is just a young girl but she is wise beyond her years having suffered horrible emotional and physical abuse.  Wavy has the misfortune to be the daughter of a meth dealer and a mentallyunstable mother.  She learns young how to take care of herself and fly under the radar.  There are lots of adults who drift in and out of her life and it is heartbreaking to see how misguided almost all of them are.  From a wellmeaning aunt to teachers who should know better everyone basically fails Wavy and her little brother.  Except for Kellen.  He smelled good.  Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen.  No stinking weed smoke.  No perfume.  No sadness.  He smelled like love  He is the one constant in her grim life the one person she can always count on no matter what.  He provides her with shelter clothing all the basic needs that a parent should plus love.  I never viewed their relationship as odd mostly because of the insightful points of view of the main characters.  But for sure some readers will be uncomfortable with their age difference.  The authors use of different narrators is brilliant.  Especially sympathetic is Wavys cousin who is in awe of Wavys wild ways.  Wavy lives on and off with her aunt and cousins but they really never know the depth and depravity of Wavys unstable home life.  Wavy in her black leather boots didnt fit in the catalog.  She tore open the catalog and made surprising things happen.  Like Ken in a dress.  This book is the best book Ive read all year.  I could not put it down.  My favorite parts of the book are when the author Bryn Greenwood describes how painful it is for Wavy to speak.  Words are almost real tangible things for Wavy that can be felt and tasted.  Brilliant.  This story spans many years and is filled with some of the most unforgettable characters that I have ever read.  I absolutely loved how whipsmart Wavy was and how she silently observed and took in everything around her.  She is obsessed with the constellations and her sweet spot is gazing at the stars at night with her beloved Kellen.  I liked learning things.  How numbers worked together to explain the stars.  How molecules made the world.  All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years.  Wavy never lost hope and pushed forward though life no matter how dire her circumstances were.  My heart also broke for Kellen a giant of a man who always treated Wavy with love and tenderness.  They had a bond that was unbreakable.  I cant think of anything more to say about this stunning book other than to please read it!  It will change your life.  I wanted a fairy tale ending for Wavy because if she could find happiness there would be hope for me too.,5,False
158, Its never too late to change the road that youre on.  The synopsis for this book really grabbed my attention.  Jessica is a doctor at a womens prison and finds old letters written by an inmate that were never delivered.  She makes it her mission to find the man the letters were written to and her search leads her to a small beachside town.  The residents are a tightknit group but Jessica who had been restless in her professional and personal life finally feels like she is home.  This is smalltown romance at its best.  I LOVED this very sexy tender warmhearted and mature love story!!  My favorite kind.  The One Real Thing has fabulous writing and interesting real and loyal secondary characters.  Cooper and Jessica share a deep connection and if you like offbeat characters with some good oldfashioned romance then you will love this book.  I am looking forward to more books in this series about the rest of the inhabitants of Harts Boardwalk.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
159, .   Stars  A totally addictive but very very sad story.  I felt like I was witnessing a train wreck!  The writing was for the most part very gripping but this book is NOT for everyone.  Tori is a romance author who feels very restless and unfulfilled in her personal life.  Her husband Landon is a rising star in the restaurant world and she has two young children.  She seeks fulfillment outside her marriage and finds one in an online relationship that eventually turns into a fullblown affair.  Many tears are shed and much angst ensues.  The writing style threw me off a bit and interfered with my enjoyment of the story but overall I will say that I couldnt put this book down.  So for that kudos to E.K.  Blair!,4,False
160, . STARS!  Hellllooooo Coach Winter!!  What a sexxxxy and intense sports romance!!  I loved it!!  Fascinating characters a timely storyline and SUPERhot steamy scenes make this book a winner!!  R.S.  Grey shows that she can write a great adult romance with this story.  With the  Summer Olympics right around the corner this book about Olympic athletes hits all the right notes.  Plus it offers an intimate look into the oftenisolated life of an elite gymnast.  I didnt have a lot of friends growing up.  In gymnastics if youre good youre lonely.  Brie Watson is the Cinderella story of the international gymnastic world.  She and her mother have sacrificed EVERYTHING to get her to the Summer Games.  And her coach Erik Winter knows all too well the pressures she is under having suddenly dropped out of competitive athletics when he was at the top of his game.  They are kindred souls even though they fight constantly and even in the face of Eriks apparent iciness towards her.  She was fierce she wanted to be seen and not just for her gymnastics skills.  No she wanted to be desired.  Coveted.  Craved.  Had anyone ever touched her the way she wanted to be touched?  This might be THE sexiest book yet from Ms.  Grey.  The passion between the hero and heroine literally lept off the pages!!  I absolutely love the enemiestofriends trope and it is done to perfection here.  Toying with Brie was quickly becoming my favorite pastime and a part of me wondered why I was doing it.  Yes she was disrespectful and constantly talked back during practice but she was hardly the first strongheaded girl in my gym to be guilty of that.  No I was enjoying her punishment a little too much.  OUT OF BOUNDS has the perfect blend of intense sports scenes sexy adult romance and emotion.  Theres no unnecessary drama here just a perfectly readable hot romance with a fantastic cast of characters.  Even if youre not a fan of sports romance give this one a try.  You will fall in LOVE with Brie Watson and Erik Winter!  Favorite quote:  She wanted to be someones voice when they were beaten down lost forgottenbut now it was my turn to stand up for her.

161, . Stars!  Dont focus on the what ifs.  Focus on what is.  Vi Keeland continues to shine in this very enjoyable and wellwritten office romance.  I have loved Ms.  Keelands writing ever since I read her MMA Fighter series Worth the Fight is a fantastic book and very underrated in my opinion.  I am thrilled to see her show off her wonderful writing style with Bossman a story that combines elements of humor wit and the perfect amount of drama.  Reese is the kind of heroine I love: smart driven a little sarcastic and very funny.  She and Chase meet when she is stuck on a very bad date and he comes to her rescue.  The whole situation is handled so perfectly!  Chase is totally sexy and funny and charming and surprise!  It turns out that he is the founder of the company where she is starting a brandnew job.  The company has a nofraternization policy plus Reese has been burned by in the past when she slept with a coworker.  She has no intention of dating Chase but he sure has fun pursuing her.  Chase leaned over to me as we continued walking down the hall and whispered Stop worrying.  Harassment policy only applies to employees not the owner.  Checked this morning.  I absolutely loved the slowburn romance between Chase and Reese!  Even though they do not fall into bed immediately there is plenty of steam and genuine emotion when they do get together.  She is scared of getting into a relationship with Chase because he is her bosss boss but Chase really cares for her and is impossible to resist.  But just when you think everything will be perfect for these two his past overcomes him and it seems as though he will never recover from the terrible trauma of an earlier relationship.  Sometimes you dont know what youre missing until you find it  I have to connect with the main characters to care at all about a story and I really connected with Reese and Chase.  The book combined funny dialogue with some heavy emotion and it all just worked!  I hope Vi Keeland writes more of these kinds of stories because they really show off her talent.  I absolutely fell in love with Chase!!  Hes the total package and Reeses feelings for him just felt right.  Im tired of looking back.  Its been a long time since Ive wanted to live in the moment.  If you are new to Vi Keeland give Bossman a try!  Its got the perfect combination of great chemistry emotion a sexy and damaged hero and witty banter.  I read this book in almost one sitting and loved the conclusion to Reese and Chases story.  Bossman is another great story from Vi Keeland surprisingly angsty with the perfect amount of steam!

162, . Stars  If you like lots of high school drama then this book is for you!  Broken Prince reminded me of Gossip Girl in many ways.  However the overthetop cruelty of Reed and Ellas fellow students here turned me off.  The main characters have lots of promise and I really loved Reed and Ella.  Many readers love this series so I am in the minority on this one and definitely pick this one up if you are in the mood for a guiltypleasure read!  He told me to stay away.  He told me I didnt belong.  If only Id listened to him.  The first book ended on a major cliffhanger and in this second installment former meanboy Reed is desperate to find Ella.  She has brought happiness and goodness to his royallyscrewed up family and he will do anything to bring her home and win back her love.  BUT there are SO many obstacles standing in their way!  I can play this two ways.  I can walk away.  Or I can fight for you.  Guess which one Im doing?  This is very quick read and a very fastpaced story.  The writing duo that makes up Erin Watt are incredibly talented and I love their other books.  If you know going in to Broken Prince that this is basically a teen soapopera then you will LOVE this juicy bit of fluff.  But be warned: there is another cliffhanger!  I did love reading Reeds POV in this book.  I felt his pain and the pressure he was under to try and protect the innocent Ella at all costs.  I also loved the VERRRRY sexy Royal brothers!!

165,   . STARS!  Thrilling sexy secondchance contemporary sports romance with a twist.  Somehow it all works in this perfect summer read!  And they would fight to their end for me.  This team was my family my soul.  And I think that was what made everything that happened so damn complicated.  Tyler has grown up traveling with a baseball team her whole life.  Baseball IS her life.  She has been homeschooled innocent yet stunning and complete unaware of her effect on men.  Then baseballs bad boy Chase Stern enters her life.  A largerthanlife character Alessandra Torre could have made him a cliche but he is deeply sensitive devoted to the game and ready to give up his fastliving ways for Ty.  Chase Stern.  The best bat to hit our game since Barry Bonds.  A shortstop who made Ripken look like a rookie.  A body built for baseball a face that made GQ editors swoon and enough swagger to fill Dodger stands with females.  Of course Ty is forbidden to go near him she is only  at the time and he plays for the team her father works for.  But they fall deeply in love with each other through stolen nights on the baseball field and living life on the road.  She knows that he is completely offlimits but these two share a deep bond that goes beyond the game of baseball.  But it wasnt his looks that had sucked me in.  It was his play.  His effortless grip of a game that we all struggled with.  His swing his throw the dip of his body when he scooped up a ball the stretch of his sixfoot body when he leapt in the air ... it was my porn.  But then...the emotional onetwo punch from the author hits and these two are suddenly irrevocably separated .  My heart broke for them!!  Flashforward several years and these two now adults with their own lives meet again.  I absolutely LOVE secondchance romances and MOONSHOT has everything I love about this trope.  First loves were supposed to be flimsy and temperamental.  They were supposed to burn bright and fade fast.  They werent supposed to stick.  They werent supposed to eat away at a mans heart his capacity for life.  Interwoven with this forbidden love story is a thriller aspect which slowly builds toward a terrifying conclusion.  Ms.  Torre is one of the few authors I know who can perfectly pull off such a clever post twist!!  I was totally blindsided by this turn of events and it blended in perfectly with the story.  It must be said that the author knows a LOT about the game of baseball and I loved reading about this part of the story she has fabulous insight in to the game and I almost felt like I was in the stands ready for the players to take the field.  MOONSHOT has everything I love about contemporary romance: deeplyfelt characters the sweetness of first love very adult steamy love scenes and the bittersweet pain of secondchance romance.  Please keep in mind that there is cheating in this book: this aspect of a story NEVER bothers me or affects my enjoyment of a novel but it is here in MOONSHOT plain and simple.  Does it resolve itself?  Absolutely.  Alessandra Torre is an automatic oneclick for me andI loved this story!!  Happy reading!  Favorite quote:  Certain loves cant be fought.  The harder you tried the harder you would be knocked back over and over again until it beat you into submission until your heart caved and body surrendered.  Love like that didnt know the rules of society it didnt care about life mistakes.  It only knew what must be and what would happenno matter what.

166, Smoking hot conclusion to The Player!!  Loved it.  Filled with warmth heat and plenty of angst.  K. Bromberg is my goto author for mature emotional romances about real people dealing with real issues and facing them headon.  And The Catch delivered on all counts.  I loved the indepth look into the sport of baseball but you do NOT need to be a fan of sports romances to love this story!  and the glimpse into the emotional highs and lows experienced by star athletes AND by their families and loved ones!  The end of The Player was a whopper of a cliffhanger I wont spoil it here!  and then BOOM!  The Catch does a  degree turn!  I appreciated Eastons POV here and as always Ms.  Bromberg created a male character with many dimensions.  Easton is flawed but he really puts himself out there and his HONESTY is what I loved most about him.  Easton and Scout both grew as characters and their love devotion to family and feelings for each other were absolutely spoton.,4,False
167, . Stars  The highlyanticipated third book in The Royals Series picks up right where the second book ended so the other books MUST be read in order!  While overall I liked the teenangst feel of this series the third book felt a bit rushed at times and I felt that Ella and Reed lost some of the heat and passion that fueled the first two books.  With that said this writing duo is very talented and the wild storyline certainly held my interest.  In Twisted Palace Ella is firmly in place as a member of the Royals household.  Gone is the taunting and namecalling from the first book.  Ella and Reed are now completely in love!  Sometimes I still cant believe that we all hated each other when I first got here.  Reed was determined to destroy me.  His brothers alternately taunted or ignored me.  I fantasized about running away on a daily basis.  And now I cant imagine not having the Royals in my life.  Reed has been arrested for the murder of Brooke and the evidence seems pretty strong against him.  There are tons of questions in this book.  Everyone at school is talking about Reed and giving damaging testimony against him.  His past seems to catch up to him and his future looks very grim.  Add to that is the fact that Steve is now back!  There is TONS of drama plus wild plot twists in this book which makes Twisted Palace feel much more suspenseful than the first two books.  I liked the forbiddenlove aspect of the earlier books but this book adds almost a mystery element to the series.  Reed is loyal to his core.  Hed die for his family.  Hell he mightve even killed for it.  This series is great for readers who love overthetop drama and firstlove stories.  I really liked the supporting characters and I hope some of them will get their own story!  I also would LOVE a story about Callum Royal.  While the brothers dont get as much focus here as in the earlier books fans of this series will be happy to get more of Reed and Ella.

The story flows beautifully through many different time frames and back and forth between many different points of view.  But it all works perfectly and the author has a BIG surprise waiting for fans of this series!  I feel that A Gift of Time is more than any other characters Ginnys story.  If you have read the first two books in the series and you MUST before reading A Gift of Time you know that Ginny has been through a lifetime of experiences and has had two great loves in her life.  I have always loved both Grizz and Tommy and I absolutely LOVED how the author resolves the famous Team Grizz/Team Grunt conflict here.  This book is told in flashback so all the main characters make an appearance here all leading toward a fascinating and satisfying conclusion.  There were just some secrets we had to keep hidden in our hearts to shield those we love.  It is impossible to describe the plot of A Gift of Time without giving anything away.  This series is a creative thrilling imaginative beautiful and ultimately uplifting story that I wont soon forget.  Grrizz Grunt and Kit will live on forever!  Bravo Ms.  Flynn for a fantastic conclusion to a terrific series.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
169, The dust has settled over the blood weve shed.  Nonstop action plus tons of graphic violence a feisty heroine and an excon with a soul!!  BLOOD TO DUST features a kickass heroine a damaged hero and a story that will have you saying Did I just read that??  I became a huge fan of LJ Shens after reading SPARROW and could not wait to get my hands on Prescott and Beats story.  She is hellbent on revenge on a group of men who are dangerous corrupt members of a crime family.  They have ruined her family and committed terrible crimes against her.  The only problem is that she is being held against her will by them.  She is outnumbered and defenseless.  And of her captors is Beat.  Beat served time in prison with one of the men holding Prescott captive.  He owes the a favor to one of the men the sadistic and allpowerful Godfrey and Beat whose real name is Nate just wants to fulfill his debt as soon as possible.  Nate has committed murder in the past but he wont let any physical harm come to Prescott.  As the captor and the captive spend more time together Prescott and Nate begin to bond.  Although he doesnt trust her at first and rightfully so!   these two are kindred spirits who devise a plan to to repay their debts seek vengeance and maybe just maybe find their own brand of happiness.  Were polar opposites.  Hes peace looking for color and Im strorm looking for serenity.  I love dark reads and I really liked this book the author has a GREAT sense of humor but felt the story spun out of control in some places.  With that being said Nate Vela is an unforgettable antihero!!  Sensitive strong protective and damaged I wont soon forget him.  And Prescott is one of the strongest most badass heroines I have ever read.  If you love a dark and gritty read then you will love BLOOD TO DUST.  I adore this author and cant wait to see what twisted story she comes up with next!  Tell me something beautiful his lips speak into mine.  Us I rasp.  Were beautiful and ugly and broken...and whole.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
170, This started off with a bang absolutely hilarious!  This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about.  Tapping Her is a superquick very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy with some laughoutloud moments and a great male POV.  There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and its just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads.  Not too much of a plot here so dont expect War and Peace.,0,False
171, Its always been you and no one else.  WOW!!  What a passionate emotional and sexy story!  Love betrayal loyalty forgiveness...this book has it all!!  I couldnt put this one down!!  I absolutely love enemiestolovers books especially where there is an element of revenge.  Plus I adore Mia Sheridans writing so I could not wait to read this book.  And I will admit I do sometimes judge a book by its cover and this cover is STUNNING.  So theres that.  I immediately connected with these beautifully flawed and damaged characters.  Their pain suffering humiliation and pride broke my heart and Mia Sheridan put it back together again.  While Lydia could have been a cookiecutter snobby heroine she instead came across as loyal loving and willing to admit to her past mistakes.  And they were HUGE.  A stupid and cruel act when she was a teenager led to a domino effect of tragic consequences for Brogan Ramsay and his family.  And now he is back in Lydias life hellbent on getting revenge for the pain she caused him all those years before.  Learn from you mistakes but dont let them define you now.  Find forgiveness for them and for yourself.  Watching Lydia and Brogan slowly make their way back into each others lives was painful raw and breathtaking.  So much drama and heartache separated these two that I lost thought they would never find their way back.  There is an element of romantic suspense here which Mia Sheridan got just right.  And the cast of supporting characters are all fabulous.  Fionn!!  HELLO!!  Are there some pieces that dont quite fit together?  Yes but they are nonessential to the story and the characters are so strong that they swept me away.  I was lost in this book and savored every minute of it.  Brogan Ramsay had come from Ireland with his family and I loved how the author incorporated Gaelic throughout the book.  What a beautiful and descriptive language!  Ms.  Sheridans books always leave a lasting impression and Ramsay is no different.  I am still thinking about the characters well after I finished this book.  I fell in love with Ramsay Brogan and although he hast quite replaced Archer as my favorite Mia Sheridan hero he comes close!  Dont miss Ramsay you will fall i love with these characters too.  There is such as thin veil between love and hate.  I had chosen love.,5,False
172, Villains were created not born.  That was something Id come to know as a fact.  Fans of the Rosemary Beach series will love this book.  I have read most of the books in this series and have loved some more than others and in Up In Flames Abbi Glines throws in lots of surprises!  This book is VERY different from the other books in the series!!  I was so excited for Nans book and to see how in the world the author was going to redeem this very unloveable vengeful character.  And she did it!  Nan has been the villain in this series cold spiteful and generally a bad person.  The only person who ever seemed to care for her was her brother Rush.  I devoured this book in one sitting daily because of Gannon.  OMG is he hot!!  There are two men vying for Nans heart in this book and I was so glad I didnt read any spoilers.  The author surprised me here with some very wild and explicit sex scenes.  I also loved how Nan seemed to finally make peace with her family especially with those she has been so cruel to in the past.  And yes Nanette does get her happy ending!!!  This is a sexy fastpaced read perfect for a summer beach read.  Lots of surprises in this one.  Thanks Abbi for finally making Nan into a character I could actually care about!

173, .   Riveting Stars!  Do you hate your husband?  I never hated him.  Youre about to.  Nuanced layered and intriguing I loved everything about this book!!  A mustread.  Adam Steinbeck has just been dealt a blow.  His beloved wife Diana is leaving him.  Partners in business and in life he is in total shock.  His emotions are raw exposed and real.

But Adam has been living a lie with his wife.  He never revealed to her who he really was.  A Dominant.  He gave it all up for her and now he realizes that she must have sensed he was holding something back from her never fully giving himself to her.  Perfect Diana...What would I do to posses her?  Would I change my cellular structure?  Turn my back on my identity?  Walk away from it never talk about it burn it so thoroughly into a pile of dust that not telling her wouldnt be a lie?  This raw and powerful book alternates between past and present so we really get a sense of the shared history between Adam and Diana.  This story rockets towards a breathtaking conclusion as only CD Reiss can do.  Her writing is crisp clear intelligent and very very sensual.  The depth of Adams love for his wife is almost palpable and he will not let her walk away without a fight.  And so she agrees to his detailed plan to spend  days alone together away from their business in New York City.  Adam is going to show Diana who he really is.  The stakes are high but Adam plays to win.  I can only breathe if I know shes there.  I gave her my fking soul and she threw it away.  Months ago maybe years ago.  She made a decision to throw me away.  Shes prepared for this divorce and Im swinging in the wind.  Raw.  With nothing.  No defenses.  Now what am I supposed to do?  I could not breathe while I was reading this book!!  It is incredibly sexy thoughtprovoking and emotional.  I loved every word.  The ending was nothing short of shocking and Im counting the days until the second book!  Shes my life do you understand?  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
174, You kidnapping me?  Only a little.  I have heard amazing things about the first two books in this series so I couldnt wait to read I Everything I Left Unsaid.  I did NOT feel lost reading this book even though I had not read the first two books.  Max and June/Olivia are two incredible characters  and the writing is crisp clean intense and INCREDIBLY sexy.  June has a sister who is being held against her will by a cult.  She dreams up a wild plan to rescue her which does not go according to plan and she ends up wounding and kidnapping Max a dangerous MC President.  Olivia is crazy about Max but he is a very dangerous man and cant be trusted.  She brings him to her estranged aunts house to recuperate from his wounds.  The scenes in Florida at Aunt Ferns condo are priceless.  And the slow burn starts to build between Olivia and Max both damaged people who have led pretty sad and lonely lives.  Mutual assured destruction.  You and I have sex get involved in that way...both us burn.  Both of us.  Well tear each other apart until theres nothing left to walk away from.  Olivia is a loner and doesnt dare dream of ever being happy.  She makes sure to sabotage anything good that comes into her life.  The story itself is gritty somewhat dark and definitely NOT your typical contemporary romance.  There is no instalove and it takes quite a while for those two to get together.  This book is VERY steamy and includes a sexy F/F scene that is incredibly hot.  But the action the scenes between Max and Olivia and the swoony scenes that eventually happened between Max and Olivia were all absolutely perfect.  There is a wonderful Epilogue and I loved the conclusion that Ms.  OKeefe gave to these very troubled characters.  Save your act for other people.  The lies and the show  I dont want it.  I want you.  Fucked up and crazy.  I want you.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
175, . STARS!  He changed the story.  Hellloooo Damien!!  I LOVED this very funny passionate and emotional story from the fabulous Penelope Ward!!!  Having read STEPBROTHER DEAREST I could not WAIT to dive into this story.  BUT even though that is one of my favorite books and I highly recommend it you do NOT have to read it first.  Chelsea has been left completely brokenhearted by her ex Elec.  She thought he was the one.  He declared his devotion to her and she thought they would grow old together.  But it was just not meant to be.  Chelsea moves into a new apartment in a new neighborhood to escape the memories of her old life.  At first it seems as though her HOT new neighbor Damien cant stand her but then they begin to build a fantastic friendship that turns ohsoslowly into a gorgeous romance.  Damien is a brilliant artist who also happens to own the building where Chelsea lives.  He has two Rottweilers who play a big part of this story and who are one of the reasons why Damien and Chelsea meet and get off to a rocky start to begin with.  Theres lots more to Damien then meets the eye and learning about him is part of the wonderful experience of reading this book.  Chelsea is extremely insecure after being suddenly dumped by Elec and Damiens compliments and the way he sees her really help to boost her confidence.  She is wildly attracted to Damien but he makes it clear she is in the friendzone.  But why cant they be more than just friends??  Has his heart been broken too?  What secret is he hiding?  I looked closer at what Id messaged him and realized it hadnt come through the way Id intended.  the auto correct had actually changed the message to: Wanna duck?  Great.  That was smooth.  Damien is the whole package: smart hot loving sweet attentive...but why is he constantly pushing Chelsea away?  Youre in my heart and I cant get you out.  I dont know if I want to.  Being with you is the only thing that feels right.  NEIGHBOR DEAREST is a VERY sexy characterdriven book that is totally readable and perfectly swoony.  Ms.  Ward has created another unforgettable book boyfriend with Damien.  The supporting characters are all fantastic.  And I absolutely LOVED the message of this book: things happen for a reason and just because someone leaves you it doesnt mean that you cant find happiness again.  SIGH  You know why it didnt work out with him?  Why?  Because God made you for me.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
176, All she sees is whats right in front of her.  Guys are drawn to her because of her spirit and smiles.  Shes a happy person and she makes people feel good when theyre around her.  Im not like that.  Im just kind of there.  Like empty space.  If Penelope Douglas writes a book I will read it!  And this series is one of my favorites so I could not wait to get back into these characters lives!  And what a treat!  Once again Ms.  Douglas surprises and puts a fresh spin on her beloved characters.  This book introduces us to Quinn but also sets up the next generation of characters and it was just a pleasure to read.  The author uses a story within a story here which added a layer of nuance and depth to what I thought would be a classic New Adult romance.  Ms.  Douglas gives us the backstory of Katherine Trent and Jason Caruthers and it broke my heart!  Yes you will absolutely need to read the other books in the series first but Bully and the later books are among my most cherished stories.  From adult contemporary romance to new adult stories Ms.  Douglas can do it all.  Why did you marry her?  she asked me in return.  I turned my eyes back out to the road as I would my way through her neighborhood.  Because I didnt see you first.  My heart!!  The author does a wonderful job of telling two parallel stories here.  The book felt a little sad to me at times because of the theme of lost time but the author gives her characters the perfect conclusion here.  Dont miss Next to Never!  It is a clever love letter to the fans of the Fall Away Series.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
177, Open your shirt for me little one.  Lets see if I like what Im getting for my trouble.  Shes baaaaack!!  Penelope Douglas has written another dark and delicious and riveting story in the Devils Night series.  I could not WAIT for Kais story and it was everything I hoped for!  Secrets are revealed inner desires unleashed with a heartpounding romance at the heart of to all.  Kais story was incredible.  Ms.  Douglas is one of the most talented romance writers around and I just knew that she would create another romantic suspense story like no other.  Hideaway is just as dark os Corrupt and will satisfy your every craving.  Kai is an alpha like no other  dark dangerous and SMART.  Were only ever good because there are consequences I told her.  Take those away and everyone shows their true self.  Kind of like taking off a mask.  This book alternates back and forth between the present and Devils Night six years before.  Kai has finally met his match in Banks a mysterious figure who may or may not have some connection to him.  The chemistry between them is perfect as I would expect with a Penelope Douglas book but not instant.  They have an intense and sexy connection but to say more would ruin the experience of reading this story.  I am glad I did not know too much about the plot.  It was INSANE!  Happy to hear it because Im the only man whose attention you should be trying to get and baby you got it years ago while wearing another mans clothes.  He kissed my temple his hot breath sending chills down my spine.  So you can imagine how fucking beautiful you are to me right now wearing mine.  There are tons of twists and turns and part of the enjoyment of reading this yummy tale was the ending.  This book is definitely for fans of dark romance: this is not a heartsandflowers kind of book.  But if you are a fan of the Four Horsemen from Corrupt then you will devour Hideaway!  It is raw and gritty and WILD.  And there is a fabulous sneak peek from Kill Switch Devils Night .  I cant wait to see how Ms.  Douglas tells Damons story!  This is what I wanted.  What I always wanted since the first time Id seen her.  Someone who knew me and wanted to dive with me...  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
178, . STARS!  WOW!!  What an emotional roller coaster ride!  LAST TOUCH is a totally hot and sexy conclusion with a fantastic psychologicalthriller aspect.  Laurelin Paige once again shows her incredible talent for creating nuanced characters and dominating irresistible heroes.  The ending of the first book was SUCH a cliffhanger that I could not WAIT to get my hands on the second book in this series!!  And LAST KISS does not disappoint.  Laurelin Paige writes very adult very sexy books and she kept me guessing throughout this whole story.  Emily is insatiable for Reeve in this book and their chemistry burns up the pages.  God I was hungry for him.  I roved my hands over his chest wanting to touch all of his body at once delighting at the hard muscles that met the underside of my palms.  He was solid everywhere.  A wall of strength and potency that could so easily overpower me.  I was weak in his presence incapable of anything except to yield.  I loved Reeve Sallis from the beginning of this series weird I know!  and I adored his uberAlpha ways.  He obviously loves Emily but his loyalties are called into question here.  There are tons of surprises in this book so I cant say anything about the plot in case you havent read the first book in the series which I HIGHLY recommend!!  These two are on absolutely FIRE when they are together.  These are two adults who have lived through a lot and Emily might have finally found someone with who she can be completely herself.  He leaned his hip against the vanity and folded his arms across his chest a position that highlighted both his broad shoulders and toned biceps.  You like it when I keep you guessing he said dismissively not an entirely inaccurate statement though it was a bit discomforting that he knew it so well.  And I like you on your toes he added his eyes dark as they slid the length of my body.  LAST KISS is a supersexy romantic suspense that rockets toward a riveting conclusion.  I could not put this book down!!  Laurelin Paige is on my short list of mustread authors and she kept me on my toes throughout this whole book.  The sexy times are TOTALLY hot believable adult and very raw.  There are many characters that kept me secondguessing the plot and I certainly did not see this ending coming.  Who was the bad guy?  Was there even a bad guy in this story?  You must read this book to find out!  A warning bell sounded in the back of my head though urging me to get my wits together and address .  something.  It was dificult to remember what exactly when his hands were on my breasts squeezing and pinching.  The bite of pain sent jolts of electricity through my nervous system signals that my brain read as pleasure.  Pleasure I couldnt resist.  If you are a fan of sexy suspenseful stories with an irresistible Alpha male and a very strong heroine then I highly recommend this series.  You wont be able to put these books down!

I think that perhaps everyone has a moment that splits their life in two.  When you look back on your own timeline theres a sharp spike somewhere along the way some event that changed you changed your life more than the others.  A moment that creates a before and an after.  Told from Emmas POV this book tells the story of how Emma and Jesse first fell in love.  The author does an amazing job of creating very memorable characters who seemed very real.  I felt like I knew Emma Jesse and Sam and their friends and families.  It is very important for me to feel connected to the main characters and I absolutely connected with all of the characters in this book.  I loved how Emma grew and matured throughout this book and how her relationships with those around her changed and evolved as well.  Good things dont wait until youre ready.  Sometimes they come right before when youre almost there.  And I figured when that happens you can let them pass by like a bus not meant for you.  Or you can get ready.  So I got ready.  I cannot think of enough to say about this gorgeous book!!  Emma Jesse and Sams story is so totally engrossing you will feel like you are reading about your good friends.  I cared deeply about what was going to happen to these three and was completely blown away by the direction this book took.  This is a richly written detailed story about first love family friendship and growing up.  The ending is enormously satisfying and I found myself rereading passages this book after I finished.  I was not ready to say goodbye to these characters!  ONE TRUE LOVES is certainly one of the best books of the year and one of new top favorite books ever.  Dont miss this one!

180, Ahhh is there anything sweeter than secondchance love?  I think not!  K. Bromberg once again delivers with this sexysweet secondchance love story with all new characters.  The settings the story the characters...I simply fell in love with Hayes and Saylor!  The author is one of my top goto contemporary romance authors and Sweet Cheeks is a perfect example of her easy romantic and sexy writing style.  Saylor recently called off her engagement and is shocked when she receives an invitation to her former fiancees wedding.  She is a smart driven businesswoman who owns her own bakery.  What is she to do?  While not one to engage in unnecessary drama she finds herself in an unusual situation after her assistant accidentally replies that she will be attending the wedding.

182, Well well!  The writing in The Deep End is VERY different from other Kristen Ashley books but not to fear the author turns the heat WAY up in this book.  Ill be honest I had to think about this story for a while after I finished reading it.  I loved the plot of this book.  The heroine Amelia is a Domme and is very accepting of herself and her needs.  She was unapologetic about her lifestyle and for that I applaud the author.  In many other ways she was just a normal human being with a desire to build a relationship with someone outside the BDSM scene and club life.  Amelia is a member of the ultraexclusive club The Bees Honey.  They have a very rigorous screening process and she knows the men she will meet will have to pass certain requirements before they can walk in the door.  She has never quite met the perfect sub but once she sets her sights on Olivier all bets are off.  Hes her dream man an Alpha sub who can meet her every need.  He is everything I love about a KA hero: strong confident loving and caring.  I had a bit of difficulty with their dynamic because he didnt seem like he was really a true submissive but their relationship worked.  Olivier and Amelie didnt have a typical D/s relationship if there even is such a thing but they both seemed perfect for each other.  I am a diehard Kristen Ashley fan so I will read anything this woman writes.  I LOVED the erotic aspects of this story and the BDSM scenes did not offend me at all.  I think that KA writes some very explicit sex scenes but The Deep End is VERY explicit!!  If you are a fan of this authors books then definitely give this one a try.  It is different and intriguing and has some very unique characters.  Just be prepared to be surprised.  Enjoy!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
183, .   STARS  How long does it take to fall in love?  A second?  A week?  A year?  Its like asking how long it takes to fall asleep.  Some people are gone as soon as their head hits the pillow.  Others lie awake for hours and its only when their brain stops churning for a while that sleep sneaks in and drags them under.  Thats how I visualize people falling in love.  Some people fall so easily they seem reckless.  They love freely and unashamed.  Those people are idiots.  Or at least I used to think so.  Until now.  GAH!!!  MY HEART!!  Wicked Heart is the story of Elissa who is Ethans sister from Bad Romeo  Broken Juliet.  One night she happens to run into Liam Quinn and he steals her heart.  But fate has other plans for these two and sadly Elissa finds herself without Liam and clueless as to why he disappeared from her life.  Flashforward years later and Elissa and Liam are working on the same stage production.  Excerpt now Liam is a superstar and has an equally famous fiance.  Elissa is a professional and as stage manager she is not allowed to become involved with any to the actors on the production.  Liam broke her heart years before and she is trying her best not to let his new relationship crush her again.  Liam still cares about her but being just friends with him might be too painful for her already fragile heart.  Friends is one of those terms that seems benign but has a whole host of barbedwire boundaries.  Once youve made love to someone with so much passion that his name is branded on all your cells is it possible to ever think of him as just a friend?  Or is the heat of on old flame always going to lie dormant just waiting to consume you again?  But just you dont think this book is all angst Leisa Rayven writes incredibly witty and funny dialogue to lighten up the mood.  I found myself swooning laughing AND crying while reading Wicked Heart!  A shudder of pleasure runs up my spine.  Oh I wouldnt dream of destroying such perfection.  Are those hospital corners?  If you find that sexy then yes.  I let out a soft groan.  Such a turnon.  He chuckles thinking Im teasing but Im really not.  Im a selfconfessed neat freak and knowing he keeps a tidy house makes me all kinds of hot.  Well if youre finished eyefucking my bed he says I have something else to show you.  If its a recently cleaned bathroom I dont think my bodys ready.  This book is filled with sexual tension heat humor and heartache.  The authors writing is so beautiful that I was swept away while reading this book.  While I recommend reading the fantastic Bad Romeo and Broken Juliet before reading Wicked Heart it is not necessary in order to enjoy this story.  Oh and did I mention that I LOVE Liam?

184, .   Stars  You are important and you cant be replaced.  Hang on.  NO ONE writes dark and edgy young adult books like Penelope Douglas!  I LOVE the message of this sexy and angsty book.  Ryen and Misha are unforgettable!  Even if you arent a fan of YA books Punk  has enough adult scenes and intense sexual chemistry to satisfy.  This is what keeps me coming back again and again to this authors books.  Yes there are tons of tough scenes especially hard to take are the painful scenes from high school.  Not pretty.  This book is somewhat dark and angsty and is almost a hybrid between Corrupt and the Fall Away series.  This is a classic love/hate/love story.  Both characters were pen pals from a young age pouring their hearts out to each other in a series of letters written over the years.  They felt that they could only be themselves with the other and they each brought out the best in the other.  However they have sworn to be anonymous pledging to not seek the other out on social media.  So when Ryen meets Misha in person for this first time she has no idea who he is.  Misha has been in love with Ryen for years but he hates the person she is now.  Or who he ASSUMES she is.  And then when I found out she was popular not an outcast and a cardboard cutout not at all original I became angry.  She led me to believe those things and my muse was a lie.  Yes you must suspend disbelief for a minute here to believe that two teenagers in  could really stay oblivious to the others true identity.  BUT there is so much nuance to this story and so many twists and turns that I could go along with that part of the story.  How do you tell your friend your best friend that youve been right here under her nose playing with her like a puppet?  Punk  is raw and BRUTALLY honest.  Ultimately it delivers an uplifting beautiful and important message to anyone with a negative selfimage or low selfesteem.  And for that I applaud the author.  Theyll never matter to us Ryen.  No one knows how this feels.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
185,   . Stars!  Sexy sweet and heartwarming with some very witty moments.  My first Lex Martin book and I loved it!  You can absolutely read Shameless as a standalone even though Brady appeared in Finding Dandelion.  Shameless has heart characters I connected with and wonderful supporting characters.  Brady is a tattoo artist who happens to have a Fine Arts degree and also rides a Harley.  He travels from Boston to his brothers farm in Texas after a sudden tragedy to take over the care of his baby niece.  I was already swooning before I even got to the baby part.  Here is this hot man tattoos decorating his rugged arms muscles tugging at the fabric asking me about the babys binkie while he holds her close to his chest.  Katherine is helping with the care of the baby and staying on the farm after the sudden loss of her best friend.  She is nerdy but beautiful and sweet and Brady is very attracted to her.  He is drawn to her kindness and devotion to the baby and the farm.  And when he learns about her background...well his heart and my heart broke for her!  She had a very tough childhood but attended college on a full scholarship.  She is hardworking and humble but Brady thinks they can never be in a committed relationship.  He needs to go back to Boston and Katherine has roots in Texas .  Plus they are both dealing with loads of grief and guilt.  Not the best time to fall in love.  It is very hard for a writer to create a connection between her characters and the reader but Lex Martin has done an outstanding job with this in Shameless.  I really cared about Katherine and Brady and what would happen to their new family and to blossoming their relationship.  Shameless is swoony and passionate and funny and sexy with the added bonus of the fantastic Texas Hill Country setting.  This was a solid romantic read for me with all the right elements.  Brady was tender sexy and hot Katherine was funny smart sexy and strong.  I am still thinking about these characters days after finishing the book which is always a good sign for me.  I cant wait to go through my Kindle and read Lex martins other books!  Favorite quote:  When you find your own little slice of heaven on Earth you do everything you can to preserve it.

186,  . Twisted Stars!  I could be whatever I wanted beneath him.  WOW!!  What a dark and delicious ride.  NOT for everyone but I loved it.  Nikki Sloane is a writer of very erotic and sexy stories.  I have enjoyed her earlier books so I was very intrigued when she announced she was writing a dark romance.  SORDID is very different from her earlier books and features a shy somewhat nerdy smart heroine.  Addison goes to a frat party where she meets up with her crush Luka a teaching assistant from one of her math classes.  Addison is insecure and socially awkward and wants to let go for once in her life.  She has too much to drink at the party and ends up with Luka.  The story then takes a  degree turn and Luka turns out to be extremely dangerous and controlling.  He literally captures Addison and wont let her go.  SORDID contains scenes of nonconsensual sex so if this is a trigger for you do not read this book.  Luka is sexy and desirable BUT he is also cruel and abusive toward Addison at the beginning of this story.  Nikki Sloane redeems him a little by the end of the book which also has undertones of romantic suspense but this is a very very dark book.  With that said the sex scenes are also incredibly hot and erotic and the story is very fastpaced and surprising.  His reality is cruel and dark.  He traps me in his web his power twisting tighter the more I struggle until its hopeless.  I cant break free.  This is an edgy graphic story with a fascinating cast of characters.  Lukas motivations are revealed by the end of the story but we never really know what he is thinking because the book is told from Addisons POV.  I loved how she stayed strong throughout this story even as she was incredibly conflicted about her feelings toward Luka.  Their relationship was certainly nontraditional for sure but it somehow worked for me.  Luka had a raw appeal and accepted what kind of person he was.  SORDID is not the most graphic or taboo book I have ever read but it is close.  Nikki Sloane is a gifted writer and my only issue with the book is that I would have liked a little more written about Lukas family!  So hopefully another book will be coming that will explain more about his very dangerous family.  SORDID is a rough and raw read but fans of dark erotic romance will love this one.  There is a ton of very very graphic sex in this book.  But any book that makes me think about the characters after I have finished is a winner and trust me Luka is a VERY memorable character!  I control every part of you.  Repeat it.  I was trembling in my core.  Instinctively I wanted to fight against him but I also wanted to please.  I wanted to succeed.  I stumbled over the words.  You control every part of me.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
187, Raine Miller has written another swoony sexy and beautiful story!!  I fell in LOVE with Caleb!  I couldnt wait to read this new series from Raine Miller.  Loosely connected to the Blackstone Affair series the new Blackstone Dynasty introduces Caleb Blackstone a wealthy businessman who is handsome brilliant driven and of course all alone.  His life is filled with onenight stands and no permanence.  He neither has the time or the interest in a lasting relationship.  His family is wealthy and he does seems to have it all.  Raine Miller writes an Alpha male like nobodys business and you can add Caleb Balckstone to the short list of handsome passionate heroes.  Yes there is some instalove here BUT Raine Miller is a masterful writer and takes time to build her characters.  When Caleb first sees the pretty Brooke he smitten.  Their later chance encounter at a party leaves a lasting impression on him.  Little does he know that their families actually share a long history together.  But Brooke who is working several jobs has ZERO interest in a serious relationship.  She has suffered great loss in her life and was forced to leave her home England at a young age to live with her grandmother in America.  Caleb and Brooke are both totally blindsided by their mutual attraction.  Nothing was familiar when it came to Brooke.  Each new thing we shared together felt to me as if Id never done it before and more importantly as if I never wanted to do it again with anyone other than herever.  I loved how Ms.  Miller touched on the loneliness that both of her main characters felt.  It was very poignant and made Caleb and Brookes growing relationship all the more sweeter.  I also adored how devoted Caleb was to Brooke and their passion together was INCREDIBLE!  If you are looking for a beautifully written contemporary romance that is fairly low on the drama and angst then Filthy Rich is for you.  The author made the New England setting come alive for me and I absolutely ADORE the cover of this book.  The cover model Adam Cowie is THE perfect Caleb Blackstone.  While this book is a standalone there will be another book coming in this series in February of  for more about the Blackstone family!  When you find whatever it is that makes you happy Caleb hold on to it with everything youve got.  Your heart will let you know.

189, . Stars!  Thank you Joanna Wylde for the fabulous Tinker Garrett!!  Shes a smart feisty funny heroine who isnt  years old.  And Gage...HOLY HOTNESS!!  Gage and Tinkers story was a hot and sweet slow burn romance with the perfect amount of humor depth and emotion.  I read a lot of MC stories and Joanna Wylde remains one of the best writers in this genre.  The Reapers is one of my favorite MC series and I knew from the first few pages that this would be an exciting witty and sexy story.  Gage is above all else loyal to his club.  He hates his current undercover assignment mainly because he has a fake girlfriend which is stopping him from claiming the stunning Tinker.  The Club always comes before all else.  Reapers forever forever Reapers.  Sometimes loyalty sucks.  Tinker Garrett is certainly not Gages usual type  she is smart runs a thriving business owns her own home and is taking care of her elderly father.  Not the usual young girls Gage toys with.  And I absolutely adored Tinkers best friend!!  But Gage soon realizes he could have something real and beautiful with Tinker and he sets out to claim whats his.  I turned catching the back of her head and pulling her in for a hard kiss because fuck loyalty.  There is a lot going on in this book plotwise no question.  But Ms.  Wylde ties everything together AND really makes you CARE about the main characters.  As always the Washington State setting is perfect and wellresearched.  And can we talk about the ending and the fantastic Epilogue??  Both surprisingly sweet and sentimental they added another level of emotional depth to an already great story.  REAPERS FIRE is another fantastic sexy and totally engrossing story from the talented Joanna Wylde.  When you look back at this moment I want you to remember there was a BEFORE I claimed you and an AFTER.  Now its after.  You got me?

191, . Stars!  One is enough.  Its unique.  Its a chance an opportunity an experience.  One is never greedy.  One is independent.  One can change everything.  Jewel E. Ann has become my new favorite author!!  I DEVOURED the Jack  Jill Series and One features two characters from that series.  Although this book can technically be read as a standalone PLEASE PLEASE read the unforgettable books in the Jack  Jill Series first because there are some major spoilers.  The author calls this genre Romantic Comedy but it so much more!  Swoony romance funny dialogue dramatic moments and SEXY scenes...Cage and Lake are two very memorable characters.  Lake became an amputee after a tragic car accident that took the life of her fiancee.  She has moved away from her family in California to Minneapolis where she once again runs into the football star Cage with whom she once shared an unforgettable kiss.  She cat get Cage out of her head and cant believe he remembers her too.  Cage really sees Lake not her disability and she cant get him out of head.  Mind if I lose the leg?  I asked.  He shook his head.  There really were no words to describe how his lack of any sort of reaction made me feel.  Not one flinch.  Not one nervous glance at my leg.  Not one second of hesitation.  Cage is sexy warm and loving.  He falls fast for Lake who is impulsive funny a little insecure and very very honest.  She makes a living by testing artificial limbs and her work takes her all over the world.  A trip to China provides one of the BEST scenes in the whole book!!  It is so hard to categorize any of Jewel E. Anns books they really cover all the bases and I ended up highlighting half this book.  My mouth said thank you but my heart said I love you.  Lake is quickly thrust into the world of NFL pro football and things arent always easy.  Her family makes an appearance in this book and they are always there to support her.  There are some very dramatic moments in this book which provided some very unexpected and very surprising twists as only this author can do.  The supporting characters are as always absolutely fantastic Flint!  Hello!!  Would love to read your story!!  Warm sexy and laughoutloud funny ONE is another home run from this amazing author.  Give me you.  Give me every tear.  Give me every breath.  Give me every fear.  Give me every touch.  Give me every smile.  Give me every day.

192, Ahhhhh!!  Theres nothing like a Kylie Scott romantic comedy.  Ever since Lick I have been a huge fan of her witty and sexy writing.  I am calling Twist a friendstolovers story because Alex meets her ideal man online and they really do become friends even though it is through a dating site.  She decides to surprise him and travels all the way to Coeur dAlene Idaho.  SURPRISE!  It turns out she was not communicating with Eric but instead was really emailing with Joe his brother.  A big sexy lumbersexual brother.  Not her type at all.  Oh no.  With all the bodyshaping underwear lip gloss heels and tiny dress you could almost say Id been fibbing about who I was.  His lie however  left my Spanx and pushup bra way behind.  Joe is beyond shocked to see Alex in person and her alreadyfragile ego takes a nose dive.  One thing leads to another and Alex decides to stay in town and realizes that Eric is actually not her type at all.  It is Joe is the one who she really developed the relationship with.  In all his bearded muscled glory.  Kylie Scott is a truly gifted writer and the banter banter between her characters is priceless.  While we all know this story will have a happy ending it is the journey there that is so satisfying.  Alex is a real relatable and very funny heroine and the scenes between her and Joe are GOLD.  No more hiding or denying sticking to the sidelines of life.  It was my time to step forward and be brave.  When it came to Joe Collins I was more than ready to say yes.  Alex is hilarious and warm and real and someone you would want as your best friend.  The whole gang from the Dive Bar series is here plus my favorites from the Stage Dive series.  BUT with that said this is a complete standalone and you do not need to have read any of the earlier books.  Twist had plenty of steamy hot scenes and I think Joe Collins might be one of my favorite Kylie Scott characters.  Joe and Alex have amazing chemistry and there is just enough angst to add the perfect amount of tension to this romance story.  And all the kudos to Kylie Scott for writing a STRONG female heroine who goes after what she wants!!  YES!!  This is a funny sexxxxxy wellwritten and lighthearted romantic comedy.  It has the perfect mix of dirty laughoutloud humor and wellrounded characters.  Im booking a flight to Coeur dAlene.  FAVORITE QUOTES:  When it came to Joe Collins my pussy was a wanton whore.  And seriously who could blame it?  His body was one big beautiful playground.  There wasnt an inch of him I didnt want to explore.  Basically he said voice little more than a rumble with your permission I just want to hold you down and make love to you for a good long time watching your face as you come.

193, We were two cousins in love with the same girl.  I really liked this book!  I have never read anything by Katy Regency before and I love her style of writing.  Set in the South Gingers Heart is a contemporary romance and a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood.  The story follows Ginger Cain and Woodman who have known each other their whole lives.  Ginger has always loved badboy Cain while his cousin Woodman has been in love with Ginger since she was a young girl.  Cain knows he cant have Ginger he is loyal to his cousin and he stays away from Ginger.  Both boys enlist in the military and the story follows the three of the through the years.  I love a good love triangle and even if you are not a fan the way Katy Regency is beautiful and passionate and emotional.  It is easy to see why Ginger could not really choose between Cain and Woodman.  Cain is the one who play the wolf role in this story he has a good heart but he has never lived up to his familys expectations for him.  He is sexy wild and irresistible.  But he is fiercely loyal to his cousin and he treats Ginger like a princess.  He was uncouth bad mannered irreverent impertinent and irresponsible with a mouth like a sailor before hed become a sailor and a dick that had seen so much indiscriminate action its a wonder it still worked.  Everyone exited Ginger to spend the rest of her life with Woodman.  He is devoted to Ginger and she loves him but not the same way that she loves Cain.  I really liked Woodman and was rooting for Ginger to love him!  This book takes a very surprising turn near the end which I did not see coming.  I absolutely loved the span of years in this book and loved watching Ginger grow up.  Katy Regency makes both Cain and Woodman very sympathetic characters and the story is romantic sexy and very emotional in some parts.  It doesnt make one of us a villain and one of us a hero.  You cant help who you love.  But someones heart was goin to break.  This is a very engaging and lovely story with a very creative twist.  I loved it and cant wait to read more books from Katy Regnery.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
194, I FINISHED!!!  This book took me FOREVER to read!  But I am so glad I stuck with it I really loved it.  It took me a while to get into: this book has a TON of characters and storylines.  But once I hit about the page mark I became very invested in the story and couldnt wait to see what would happen with Lizzie Lane Edward Gin and the rest of the family.  Oh and Samuel T. Theres a little bit of sex but mostly this is a sweeping romance novel much like Dynasty and Dallas from the s.  If you loved those series you will love this book.  Theres betrayal unrequited love family fortunes and much scheming.  There are many characters to love here and many to hate.  Some are overthetop but I loved the central storyline involving Lane and Lizzie.  The author really gets the Southern mannerisms right and the backdrop of the Kentucky Bourbon industry is fascinating.  This book ends not so much on a cliffhanger but with many many loose ends and I will eagerly pick up the next book in this series.,4,False
195, Shes the love of my life.  And Im not walking away from her even for a second.  A Thousand Boy Kisses is a lovely poignant and sweet comingofage story with just the right amount of heat.  Poppy and Rune are sure to become two of Tillie Coles most beloved characters.  I fell in love with both of them!  Kiss eight hundred and nineteen was the kiss that changed it all.  The kiss that proved that a longhaired brooding boy from Norway and a quirky girl from the Deep South could find a love to rival the greats.  Hopefully you havent read any spoilers for this book because I will say that the ending COMPLETELY surprised me!  These two completely and totally loved each other from the time they were children.  They were inseparable.  Then Rune suddenly has to move away with his family but the worst heartbreak was that Poppy cut him off with no explanation.  His heart was broken.  But thats not even the sad part of the book.  Rune returns several years later but he is different changed all because of what he suffered through.  Poppy is devastated to realize that her treatment of Rune is what caused him to become moody and cold towards her.  When she finally tells him the truth about why she cut him off he becomes totally devoted to her.  Please listen to the authors own description of this book as a tearjerker!  Because thats what it is.  I loved Runes absolute devotion to Poppy and her strength and bravery was beautiful.  This is an extremely emotional book but yet the story and the characters are incredibly engaging.  I loved everything about this book from the gorgeous cover to the story behind the thousand kisses.  Grab a box of tissues and be prepared to fall in love with Poppy and Rune.  ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
196, . GoldMedal Stars!  SCORE!!!!!  I knew when I read the synopsis for this book that I absolutely had to read it!!  After falling in love with Liam and Kinsley in SCORING WILDER I could not WAIT for R.S.  Grey to release this sexy funnyashell story about the Summer Olympic Games in Rio.  Throw in a sexy British swimming superstar and a funny beautiful and driven soccer player and Im all in.  The Summer Games is definitely NOT just for fans of sports romance.  This story is addictive fun enjoyable and very very funny.  R.S.  Greys oneliners are absolutely hilarious.  Andie is a champion womens soccer player in Rio for the Olympic games.  Shes young fit focused on the competition but ready to let loose in the Olympic Village.  I had to keep up my workouts and diet.  Sure Id nearly chugged a bottle of vodka the day before but sometimes vodka counts as medicine.  Of course she was warned to stay away from badboy British swim champion Freddie Archibald but Andie is just what Freddie needed in his life.  He is promised to another woman an uptight social climber to whom appearances are everything.  Caroline is the opposite of Andie and Freddie has no intention of continuing with their sham engagement.  R.S.  Grey really brings in on in the romance department in this book.  This is is MUCH sexier than some of her other books and I absolutely ADORED it!!!  Andie and Freddie are incredible together.  But will their romance continue after they have both left the Summer Games behind?  I needed her more than I needed my next race.  The water was soothing but Andie lit me on fire.  I loved how strong and competitive Andie was and how she stayed laserfocused on her team and the games.  And I always love a dual POV  and R.S.  Grey executes the male POV perfectly here.  Oh and Freddies sister Georgie was funny and charismatic and I would love a book about her!!  Just saying.  I highly recommend The Summer Games it is completely addictive!  I cant wait for the next book in this series!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
197, ... I guess its like reading a good book.  The kind where you dont want to skip pages to see what happens at the end.  Each moment is a story in itself.  Swear on This Life is one of THE best secondchance romances Ive ever read.  This book is perfection!!  I really cant do justice to this beautiful and heartwrenching story.  This is one of those books that absolutely must be experienced by reading the authors own perfectlycrafted words.  Swear on This Life is incredibly imaginative creative and heartstopping and is one of my favorite books this year.  I finished this book months ago and have been thinking about it ever since.  It is a book I have been telling all my nonbookish coworkers and friends to read.  I completely tuned out the world when I read this book and wanted to spend every waking minute reading it.  The past and present blend together seamlessly in this book and there are flashbacks within flashbacks.  This could be confusing BUT Renee Carlino does it brilliantly here.  There are really  main characters in this book: reallife Emiline and Jace and fictional Emerson and Jackson.  The early days of the real main characters and the fictional characters are absolutely harrowing.  Emiline has now escaped her past and grown up to make a perfectly nice life for herself.  She struggles however to find her voice as a writer.  She has tried her best to put her painful past behind her but reading the popular bestselling book featuring Emerson and Jackson has brought her childhood crashing into her presentday self in a way she is not quite ready to face.  Most of the time people who are lost dont ever find their way back.  I like to be challenged as a reader and Swear on This Life did just that.  It is a fascinating and unique secondchance romance like none other.  At times excruciatingly painful and brutally honest the book is also romance and womens fiction at its very best.  There is actually some humor to lighten up the overall heavy tone of the book along with an intensely sweet first love story.  Emotional and satisfying Swear on This Life is a mustread.  Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect but until you know the whole story its impossible to see the universe at work or even admit that there is something bigger than us making sure everything that should happen does happen.

198, Original fresh fastpaced sexy.... LOVED every word of this book!  L.J.  Shen has written an incredibly thrilling and amazingly satsifying book.  I love her writing style and cant wait to read her other books.  This story grabbed me by the throat from the first word and didnt let go until the very last page.  And what a beginning!  Sparrow has found herself in a sudden arranged marriage to one of Bostons most notorious criminals Troy Brennan.  He has a troubled past.  A disastrous future.  And Im about to become a part of his present whether I like it or not.  Sexy dangerous with not one ounce of kindess or compassion Troy is a feared and legendary figure in Bostons crime circles.  Sparrow has known of him all of her life having grown up on the mean streets of Boston and with a father who was a lowlevel member of one of Troys father gangs.  Sparrow has no clue why she has been forced into this marriage because Troy seems to hate her as much as she hates him and they both seem revolted by the idea of being married to each other.  Dear future wife... He smirked in a way that made me want to beg for mercy.  If you think youre going to give me trouble think again.  I invented trouble.  I stir it I mix it I fucking fix it.  Dont try my patience because youll discover I have absolutely none.  Sparrow is feisty resilient smart and yes very innocent and sheltered in many ways.  She has no qualms about standing up to Troy and he actually likes it.  Sparrow is different from all the golddigging women who are only interested in his wealth and his power.  He actually kind of likes her in his own sick very twisted way.  But Sparrow learns quickly how to survive in her gilded cage and is thrilled when Troy agrees to let her work in one of his restaurants.  The sexual chemistry in this book is explosive!!  Troy is the ulimtate bad boy.  But what makes this book so unique is the witty sarcasm from both her main characters and the crsip and snappy dialogue.  I read this book in almost one sitting and I still want more!  I was in love with a murderer who didnt love me back who never explained why he took me for his wife.  It wasnt fine wasnt okay but it was the ugly embarrassing uncomfortable truth.  Considering how fucked up my truth was I began to understand why Troy gave me something far more convenient and beautiful.  He gave me lies and I ate them from the palm of his hand.  He gave me lies and for him I closed my eyes.  This book rockets forward at a breakneck speed with an incredible storyline that kept me guessing until the very end.  There are many memorable supporting characters but Troy and Sparrow are the main focus and i kept hoping that Troy wasnt really as evil as he seemed to be.  Sparrow is no pushover and I absolutely adored the ending that author gave these two.  This book is one of my favorite books so far this year and it is defintely the most original.  I highly recommend this story and cant wait to read more from this author!  FAVORITE QUOTE:  Failure is inevitable he continued in a flat tone that didnt hold much emotion or hope and heartache is unstoppable.  One day Ill forget to clip your wings.  When that day arrives when you run away I guess Id be happy to know youll still have some money and the means to make it in this wild tough world.,5,False

200, . STARS!!  Falling in love might not have been on my list...but Im glad I fell in love with you Liam.  I read this witty funny SEXXXXY beautiful story in one sitting.  Do NOT let the title scare you away!  The Ending I Want is a very positive story in many ways even though the plot is pretty much revealed early on in the book.  Samantha Towle is such a capable writer that this story could have turned into a tired cliche.  Instead it is an exciting fastpaced immensely enjoyable book with two very memorable main characters.  Can we talk about Liam?  At first I thought Oh no not another wealthy British businessman!  But he is warm smart sensitive and ALPHA all rolled up into one perfect package.  The problem is that Taylor Shaw only has plans to visit England for two very short weeks.  Which means that she might have to tell Liam about the secret that she is trying notsosuccessly to hide from him.  I would have stayed because Im pretty sure I was in love with you from the moment you surprisekissed me on the plane.  You had me instantly.  The Ending I Want is not overlysentimental or sappy.  Instead it is the perfect mix of humor hope and love.  I absolutely loved this unexpectedly beautiful story.  Oh and The Mighty Storm fans  watch for an appearance by Jake Wethers!  Favorite Quote:  Im smiling and laughing and doing something that scares the crap out of me.  Im living because of Liam.  And that thought alone brings with it a whole new brand of fear in me.  A fear that terrifies me in a way that I have never known before.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
201, Just WOW.  My first Kim Jones book and it absolutely BLEW ME AWAY!  Sinners Creed excited me stunned me shocked me and yes even made me cry.  Which is not an easy feat.  Even if youve read a lot of MC books this book will surprise you and thrill you and I cant recommend it highly enough.  This is an unwavering noholdsbarred look into club life with all of the violence sex and raw emotion you can imagine.  Brotherhood comes before all else and these men will sacrifice everything for their brothers.  Dirk is no exception: he has become a notorious enforcer a nomad who travels wherever Club business takes him always alone always doing what needs to be done no matter what the price.  Saylor comes into his life quite by accident and gradually slowly they develop a deep and loving bond.  Dirk has lived a sad brutal life and Saylor finally is something good in his life.  Saylor is running from something and Dirk agrees to take her on his travels across the country.  It is best if you go into this book without knowing too much detail about the plot.  I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it.  It turns out that Saylor loves to ride and really she is the only joyful part of Dirks violent existence.  This book took a very surprising turn which was perfect for these two characters.  Some will love it some will not but take a chance on Sinners Creed and go on the Dirk and Saylors journey with them.  This book was magical gritty raw and beautiful all at once.

202, .   MISSIONACCOMPLISHED STARS!  WOW!!!  As a jaded romance reader I am rarely taken by surprise by books that I read.  Well FLY WITH ME took me by surprise from the first page!  This sexxxxy and emotional story grabbed my heart and didnt let go.  Handsome fighter pilot?  Check.  Smart curvy sweet heroine?  Check.  Two older characters who have dated a lot and know what they want and go after it?  CHECK!!  This is the first book in the new Wild Aces series and follows a group of fighter pilots.

Noah has never been tied down before until he meets Jordan in Las Vegas art her sisters bachelorette party.  She is just looking for a night of fun from her quiet life as a store owner back in Florida.  How often could you say that you could pinpoint the exact moment when your life changed?

Jordan is smart funny and open and Noah finds himself instantly attracted.  But what happens after a torrid night in Vegas?  Will Noah go back to his base in Oklahoma and Jordan home to Florida?

203, .  ADDICTIVE STARS  This place is like the Garden of Eden.  Beautiful but full of danger.  There was SO much to love about this book!  Ella the feisty smart and sarcastic survivor.  The sex lust and dirty talk.  The fastmoving storyline.  I really liked this book a lot but the overthetop teen drama the cruelty and the unecessary theatrics got in the way from making this a homerun for me.  Elle Kennedy and Jen Frederick the pair behind Erin Watt are amazingly talented and gifted writers.  Their writing talent made this book a TOTAL guilty pleasure with a very likeable and resilient heroine and TONS of hot and heavy lust and sex.  Ella Harper finds herself suddenly living in a world of almost unimaginable wealth and privilege after Callum Royal her fathers old friend becomes her legal guardian.  She is a poor girl who did what she had to support herself and get through high school.  Suddenly she is enrolled in private school and living in a house filled with Callums sons who are resentful of her to say the least.  They are on a mission to destroy her and to make her leave.  Despite their taunts and their endless bullying she refuses to leave and is only after one thing: to finish high school and go to college.  You should get away from here.  These Royals will ruin you.  Oh but theres the little detail of Reed Royal.  The meanest of them all and thats saying a lot he and Ella hate each other at first sight but then cant stay away from each other.  Even though I disliked Reed at the beginning he began to grow on me and I could see how Ella eventually found him irresistible:  He has everything a girl could want: the hard body the handsome face that will still look good years from now the money and that extra something.  Charisma I guess.  The ability to slay you with a single look.  The apple is dangling in front of me juicy red and delicious but like the fairy tale Reed Royal is the villain disguised as a pretty prince.  Taking a bite out of him would be a huge mistake.  The Royals run the school and everyone there follows their orders.  This book reminded me a lot of Beverly Hills  and Gossip Girl.  There is no question that this story is unputdownable.  I just would have liked less cruelty and a little more reality.  Nonetheless I will most DEFINITELY read the next book because this one ends on quite the cliffhanger!  I really do want to see what is next for Ella Harper.

204,  fighting stars!  Ill fight for us but Ill need you to fight too.  JB Salsbury has written a classic friendstolovers story with two characters that I loved from her previous books.  Killian and Axelle have been best friends since childhood but Kill is not your typical badboy MMA fighter.  Hes a nerd in high school and worships Axelle from afar.  He thinks she could never be interested in someone like him a geek who wears glasses quiet and nerdy.  Axelle who has bad terrible choices in men secretly loves him but she doesnt feel worthy enough for the smart driven Killian.  There is more emotion sexual tension and heartbreak packed into this book then many books twice the size.  I could not put this book down and this story touched me on so many levels that I am still thinking about it a week after finishing!  I fell in love with Killian.  He is now my favorite of all the Fighting boys.  Sweet sexy protective strong gentle  he is the TOTAL package.  And Axelle is a fantastic heroine she makes bad choices is far from perfect but picks herself up and moves on and makes a better life for herself.  She realizes early on that she cant hold Killian back from a stellar fighting career and refuses to hold him back.  I cant lose him to someone else.  But I cant allow him to pass up on a chance at happiness with someone else either.  Axelle and Killians story is emotional thrilling sexy filled with heartbreak hope and promise.  This book was perfect in every way.  The boy and girl secretly in love with each other the years spent apart the incredible sexual chemistry between the hero and heroine and the beautiful and strong families who support them both unconditionally.  I adored how the author allowed Axelle to overcome her insecurities and become her own woman.  I love everything JB Salsbury writes but FIGHTING FATE is one of her very best books!I didnt think it possible but I have become an even bigger fan after reading FIGHTING FATE.  The dual POV was perfection and I cant wait for more books from Ms.  Salsbury.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
205, Well that was very unexpected and different!  I am a huge fan of L.H.  Cosway and this is my first book by Penny Reid.  This is part of the Rugby series but can absolutely be read as a standalone.  This book is NOT your typical sports romance!  It features a gorgeous ruby star who surprisingly needs to learn some skills in the bedroom!  This is a very funny and VERY sexy take on a familiar theme and I enjoyed every word of this story.  Lucy is the sister of a star rugby player.  She is quirky different and has a very unusual way of dealing with anxiety  she has a compulsion to shoplift.  Not so easy to hide when the media is lurking everywhere.  At first she dislikes Sean her brothers teammate but beneath his badboy reputation is a kind generous and loving soul.  Beauty comes in many forms and the strong powerful kind is the most admirable.  Its easy to be weak you simply do nothing but strength takes courage and effort.  Sean has his own issues to deal with.  He doesnt seem interested in proving his teammates wrong about his cocky reputation and his family is not exactly warm and fuzzy.  Lucy is afraid of alienating her brother if he finds out that she and Sean are seeing each other so they agree to keep their romance a secret at first.  Lucy is going to teach Sean how to be a better lover  I LOVED how they did NOT start off with spectacular sex!!  But Sean is so sweet and is a very very good student.  He begins to develop real feelings for Lucy and she begins to fall for Sean too.  I dont want to close my eyes when I could be looking at you  The Player and the Pixie is a sweet funny and totally fresh story.  I absolutely adored Lucy and Sean and the very unique storyline.  These two are very memorable characters and I highly recommend this book even if you are not usually a fan of sports romance!  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
206, . DIRTY STARS!  Refreshingly funny and SOOO sexy!!  Kyle Scott is laughoutloud funny.  DIRTY is a fantastic start to a new series from Kylie Scott.  The book starts off with a bang and doesnt let up until the very end.  Lydia has run away from her own wedding climbing over a fence and right into an empty house.  Except that the owner is there and is very surprised to find a runaway bride in his own bathroom distraught and still in her wedding gown.  Even with no clothing to take cues from the dude was clearly the epitome of cool.  He looked about my age or maybe a little older.  He had longish redblond hair dark blue eyes set in an angular face a lean but muscular torso covered in tattoos and a rather large cock.  Not that I meant to check him out its just kind of hard to ignore a penis and scrotum when theyre dangling right in front of your face.  I tilted my head trying to get some perspective.  Every viewpoint however was equally shocking.  There was dick as far as the eye could see.  And I should stop ogling him.  Right.  This was supposed to be Lydias wedding day and she is to put it mildly distraught.  But she still maintains her sense of humor even in the face of a cheating exfiancee and his overbearing family.  Vaughan is a nice guy and offers to let Lydia stay with him until she is able to get back on her feet.  Even though he probably shouldnt trust a woman who has broken into his house he likes her and her curves and her smart mouth.  You touch any of my stuff?  he asked.  Take anything?  Yes your sofa is cunningly hidden down the front of my dress.  You wont believe where I fit the TV.  Again his eyes narrowed dangerously.  Between you and me probably not the time to be funny babe.  Lydia finds herself working at the local Dive Bar with Vaughan and his family and friends.  Lydia grows to love the Idaho town she has found herself in and can see herself making a life there and putting down roots.  Vaughan however is a different story.  He is chasing dreams of being a musician and isnt ready to give that up.  He and Lydia really like each other but neither one is ready for anything serious so they agree to a friendswithbenefits arrangement.  which of course means at least one of them is going to fall in love.  Hey this IS a romance after all!!  And who can resist Vaughan?  Clearly there were far more northern Idaho sex gods than Id given the region credit for.  Further classifications were going to be required.  If Vaughan topped the supercool category then maybe this new guy should win on the lumbersexual front.  Given my abrupt return to singledom Id have to give this important manclassification system more thought.  Disclaimer: Objectifying people is wrong and stuff.  DIRTY is a fun and funny sexy warmhearted romance that hits all the right notes.  There is no unnecessary drama and lots of fantastic interesting supporting characters.  I adored everything about this book.  Ms.  Scott is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I cant wait to read the next book in this series!  When his lips opened a little just enough to softly kiss my bottom lip I swear I swooned.  Over and over he kissed my lips first the top then the bottom the sides and the corner from where my smile started.  No part was left untouched.  My smile grew wider my nipples hard and my loins Vaughanaddled.  Thats a medical term.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
207, BEAUTIFUL AND PASSIONATE!  Brigs and Natasha were in love once and then a terrible tragedy struck and Brigs completely broke things off with Natasha.  She was devastated.  THE LIE is told in flashback and we see the beginnings of their love story through the present day.  This is a gorgeous secondchance romance which had me on pins and needles from the first paragraph.  Brigs is a tortured soul and I wasnt quite sure how the author was going to bring him together with Natasha.  She barely escaped their breakup with her sanity intact and cant even begin to think about him being in her life again.  Everything about Brigs is simply too painful for Natasha to deal with.  Memories of love are a poison.  My therapist told me that I have to embrace it.  Acknowledge that people fall in love all the time with people they arent supposed to that I was swept away and lost control for once in my life...  Brigs lives with crushing guilt for what happened to his family but Natasha was the love of his life.  What will he do now that she is in his life again?  I was rooting for them from the beginning and read their story in one sitting.  The writing is incredibly beautiful soulful and passionate.  Tell me what I am to you he whispers leaning in closer.  I suck in my breath.  Afraid that if I exhale Ill let all my secrets loose.  I loved this book and loved the journey that Brigs and Natasha took in this story.  THE LIE is yet another beautifully written story from Karina Halle!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
208, This series is EVERYTHING!!  Breathtaking romance redemption suspense a sly sense of humor... this entire series just knocked the wind out of me!!  This book was the perfect ending to the tale of Jackson and Jillian and all of the characters that Ive grown to love through the course of three books.  Jillian Knight has become one of my favorite heroines ever.  Damaged feisty strongwilled smart and sarcastic I was praying for her to have a happy ending!!  And her unbreakable bond with her brother was absolutely brilliant.  In so many ways the greatest love story of her life was not with Luke or AJ ... it was with Jackson.  He was the constant in her life.  His love defined unconditional.  Someday she would tell him ...  someday.  These two characters managed to fight their way out of almost unimaginable circumstances and both fought to find normalcy and happiness and love.  That sounds sappy but there is not one false moment in this book and the authors writing literally took my breath away!!  I could not put his story down until I found out what would happen to Jackson Jillian Ryn and Luke.  Be wanted that there is graphic violence in this book but it fit in with the storyline and the characters and it never felt gratuitous.  Control never lasted.  Eventually the illusion of time the pull of gravity and catastrophic events reminded everyone of their mortality and their utter insignificance in the great big world.  Life was nothing more than one long blink.  Here today.  Gone tomorrow.  I have not bingeread a series of books in a very long time.  This series was an exception and I wish I could read these books all over again for the first time!!  I ADORE this author and cant wait to read her other books.  Love is forever yet waits for no one.,5,False
209, The heart never forgets skipping a beat.  Just WOW!!!  End of Day is Kristen Ashley meets Caroline Kepnes.  Funny sexy suspenseful witty...this book literally has it all.  How did I not read this series sooner?  This clever story about a brother and sister duo who are starting a new life in Omaha Nebraska is filled with heartstopping moments and an edgeofyourseat plot.  Oh  and theres plenty of intensely hot sex too.  I highlighted a zillion parts of this book and I would write a longer review but I need to jump right into Middle of Knight.  Dont start this series if you have anything else to do because you wont be able to put it down!,5,False
210, You live  I love you  You breathe  I live  You dance  I breathe  I sing  You love me  A gorgeously written passionate and lyrical story.  My heart is singing!I fell in love with Rose and Damon and all of the supporting characters in this book.  SHOWMANCE is set in the world of musical theatre in London and centers around a production of Moulin Rouge.  Rose is an assistant choreographer and lives and breathes dancing.  But she is content to leave the spotlight to others having suffered from stage fright most of her life.  Enter Damon Atwood a reclusive superstar who stepped away from the public spotlight at the height of his fame after years spent in a quiet fishing town.  Damon will bring star power to the production and is paired with the gorgeous actress Alicia who plays his costar in the show.  Rose instantly feels tremendous empathy for Damon who is almost painfully shy in public but comes alive when singing and acting on the stage.  You have no idea the kind of betrayal Ive suffered in my life... This friendship I have with you is a big deal.  I havent let someone into my life like I have you in years.  SHOWMANCE is a very slowburn romance filled with stolen moments and tons of steamy Alpha heat.  Rose has sown off dating actors after being burned in past relationships.  But Damon sees the beautiful soul that she is and cant help but fall in love with her.  Although Damon is closedoff and shy in public when he is alone with Rose OMG!!!  Their scenes together are absolutely unforgettable.  In a heartbeat every look wed shared flashed through my mind from that initial fleeting glance across the dance studio the first time Id heard him sing to this one.  This one told me I owned his heart his soul his everything.  This story has all the elements that I love: a smart and strong heroine a damaged sensitive hero and a creative interesting plot.  I loved the behindthescenes look into theatre production and the FANTASTIC cast of supporting characters especially Roses best friend Julian.  I am THRILLED that Julian is getting his own book!!!  I cant wait to see what the author does with this character.  I could go on and on about this book it is that perfect.  L.H.  Cosway is a brilliant writer and I devoured this book.  It has the perfect mix of sexy steamy scenes and just the right amount of angst.  Dont miss this one!!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
211, This might be the most deliciously dirty Alexa Riley story ever.  I mean look at the plot stepdad and stepbrother want to fk the teenager living with them in their trailer.  But its all very sweet and in good fun even though it is nasty and totally forbidden!  If you have about / hour to spare prepare yourself for a fun filthy sexy erotic story.  Loved it!,4,False
212, How I love Carnal!  Just when I thought another Kristen Ashley hero could not break my heart any more than her earlier heroes along comes Deke Hightower.  A loner almost a recluse a man of very few words the original strong silent type!   Deke has had a hard tough life never putting down roots anywhere and never ever opening his heart to a woman.  He is a simple man a lover of his bike and the open road which he makes VERY clear to everyone he meets.  Deke and Justice have a history together he just doesnt remember it!!  but when they meet again years later they have a verrrry slow buildup and the slow burn worked perfectly for these two.  There are lots of misunderstandings lots of miscommunications but when these two get together....OMG!!!!  Expect the usual HAWTNESS and overthetop Alphamale sexiness that is pure Kristen Ashley.  One of the things I absolutely adored about this book was Deke.  He is no kid and neither is Justice and Kristen Ashley describes him as all man and then some.  ...All of it covering exceptional pecs and the most amazing stomach Id ever seen.  Not abs.  A manly stomach.  I had to admit I was over the cut leanness that was all the rage.  In the beginning it was hot.  But now it seemed daunting men being so developed they didnt have an inch of extra flesh on them not like they were human beings but like they were diagrams of a bodys muscularity.  Not Deke.  FAINTS And Justice I loved her!  She is a gifted musician with a renowned family but with lots and lots of heartache to go along with that.  But this is Carnal and she is trying to hide out and get some peace.  She hires Deke to renovate her new house and I think that Kristen Ashley must have a second secret career as a contractor.  At first I thought there was too much detail about the house renovations but then I fell in love with the wonderful detail.  Deke works with his hands he takes pride in his work and the contrast between his bluecollar background and Justices upbringing is both perfect and poignant at the same time.  She has plenty of craziness to deal with which Deke doesnt get at first.  He really closes off his heart and Justice at first hides the fact that she remembers him from years before.  He is almost sullen but all of it comes from a place of heartbreak.  My life babe he shook his head until I was about twenty it was not good.  Okay I prompted carefully not liking that.  And because a that I got a way I gotta be and thats a way thats not gonna change.  All Justice wants is love and acceptance and some peace in her life.  I loved that she was always herself around Deke and eventually he warmed up to her cheerfulness honesty and just plain goodness.  It is difficult for a man like Deke to be with a brilliant and successful woman like Justice.  But Deke being Deke accepts this in his own way.  He squatted and reached into the bag.  Open a beer for me yeah?  I live to serve.  Deke wanted to test that but do it when they were both naked.  Fuck him.  Total dumbfuck.  I must mention that FANTASTIC cast of secondary characters here.  Each and every one felt fully developed and essential to the story.  In my opinion Kristen Ashley can pretty much write about anything and I will devour it.  But when she writes about two people who have already lived a full life who have their own demons and pasts and who know what they want well to me thats a winner.  Welcome back to Carnal folks it is a beautiful place.  Enjoy the bounty.  I was living it and all I had to do was take care of it nurture it make it stronger.  Then it always would be mine.  Everything Id ever wanted.  My place in this universe.  And it felt amazing.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
213, Had the pleasure to read an early copy and it is just a beautiful story!!  A Love So Tragic is a gorgeous secondchance romance.

More to come closer to release day!,4,False
214, . STARS!  NAZ IS BACK and wicked as ever.  I am in love with this series!!!  The author continues to surprise by showing a little softer side of Naz here.  Just a little.  He is still as ruthless as ever but he remains fiercely loyal to Karissa.  He stuggles to break free of his violent past for Karissas sake but lets face it it is obvious he will never be completely free of that world.  For that reason I was on the edge of my seat throughout this whole book just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  He wants to be a better man to ease my guilt for loving someone like him.  This is a fastmoving thrilling and violent plot but completely and utterly sexy at the same time.  Naz is absolutely one of THE sexiest most controlling antiheroes and I love him!!!  This series is a mustread for fans of Mafia romance.  It is tighly written fastpaced totally sexy and has great supporting characters.  There is lots going on in this book and obviously the series must be read in order or there will be major spoilers.  J.M.  Darhower is one of my goto authors and this book delivers the goods.  Buckle up and get ready for a bumpy ride!  Many thanks to the author for the review copy.,5,False
215, Absolutely astounding!!!!  And the end was perfection.  HIDDEN BODIES begins where where YOU ended.  For those of you who do not like cliffies YOU wasnt really a cliffhanger and can absolutely be read as a standalone.  However for someone like me who is obsessed with Joe Goldberg and a little bit in love with him?  Weird I know I was thrilled that there was more to this story.  As funny as the authors commentary on NYC life was she is even funnier and more onpoint with her look at living in L.A.  Dont fear Joe is still as crazy as ever but in an almost Being There fashion everyone around him seems to mold him into what they believe him to be.  And Joe is trying.  He really is.  But is still a complete and total sociopath.  Despite that I was really rooting for him to find true love in HIDDEN BODIES.  But everyone is just so phony and materialistic and so Joe really believes he is justified in his actions.  This story is just as addictive and readable as YOU and will keep you on the edge of your seat terrified but yet laughing out loud.  Scary funny heartbreaking and amazing.  Congrats to Caroline Kepnes for another perfect book.  Thanks to Atria for a review copy.,5,False
216, In the depraved innards of my soul I thrill at being the thing she fears.  I want to claim her apprehension dread and uncertainty.  I want to take ownership of all of her emotions and be the sole reason she trembles and cries.  With those words Pam Godwin has written on my favorite studentteacher dark romances.  DARK NOTES is in the same category as UNTEACHABLE by Leah Raeder with the rapid short sentence style and the hopeless yet hopeful heroine.  But Mr.  Emeric Marceaux in in a class by himself pun intended!  with his dark dangerous and commanding nature.  He knows what he wants and will do anything to make that happen.  Ivory is a feisty but dirtpoor music student who is out of her element at the expensive and elitist music school she attends.  She is a senior and is trying desperately to make it to graduation so that she can secure a spot at a prestigious music academy.  But she is the poorest student at the school forced to do anything to survive.  She barely has money for new shoes or the school uniform let alone textbooks or the required tablet.  Emeric is one commanding and bossy man.  Whew.  I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book but my God this man is irresistible.  He never ever mistreats Ivory unlike most of the other men in her life and his heart literally aches for the proud student who refuses to take charity from anyone.  All you need is a moment...This brutal man is my home.  His hell is my heaven.  Im his Ivory and hes my darkest note.  Emeric became obsessed with Ivory and although he knew he had to stay away they were both immediately connected and believe me this girl needed his protection in the worst way.  I love Emeric and was completely invested in him and his need to protect Ivory.  This is without a doubt one of the sexiest forbidden love stories Ive ever read.  There is a fantastic brutal emotional and violent storyline that is pure Pam Godwin.  The New Orleans setting is perfection and having lived there for many years I am always thrilled when an author gets the setting of the story just right.  New Orleans is almost another character in this book with its humidity class system funky neighborhoods and diverse music scene.  Ivory is a feisty strong heroine who will do whatever she needs to survive in her brutal world.  She is no virginal innocent heroine but she does have a refreshing honesty that I loved.  Pam Godwin continues to be my goto author for dark romance and DARK NOTES is just one more forbidden romance that hits all the right notes.

217, .   SMOKING HOT STARS!  OMG I loved this book!!!  Perfect mix of total hawtness and great writing.  Funny sexy engaging.  not what I expected AT ALL.  Laurelin Paige and Sierra Simone are the complete package.  I highly recommend this one!  Logan is a porn star but he really loves his job and makes no apologies for what he does.  I loved the behind the scenes look into the porn industry and found it fascinating.  Logan has had his heart broken by another adult film star but he has fantasized for years about Devi who he met on set.  Can two porn actors find true love together when their jobs involve having sex with other people?  Believe it or not this book is actually full of romance along with the amazingly hot sex scenes and dirty talk.  Logan is actually very sweet and Devi is filled with dreams of going back to school and maybe just maybe having a real relationship with Logan.  They make a realitytv type of film together which follows them as they pretend date but they both begin to fall for each other.  The lines between their series and reality quickly become blurred.  This book is filled with surprises and even has some very funny moments.  I love both of these authors and their first book together is hot sweet and a total guilty pleasure.

218,  SEXY FUN STARS!  I will admit I did not think I would love this book as much as I did!!  I am a HUGE fan of Alessandra Torres writing but I really thought this story might be a little too fluffy for me.  I was completely wrong!!  It is sexxxxxy fun sarcastic witty and a love letter to New York City.  The formatting of the book is gorgeous and very very clever.  Chloe lived a pampered life as part of New York Citys wealthy elite.  As an NYU student she never had worry about such trivial things as money or tuition.  All of that comes to a screeching halt when her parents lose everything after being assessed of insider trading.  But Chloe is nothing if not resourceful and finds a job as a personal assistant to a spoiled mean and selfcentered socialite who also thinks of herself as an actress.  The wealth of the city lived in a different bubble than the rest of us.  One where there were no worries of minor problems the majority of which were easily solved by money.  One comprised of beautiful women powerful men the drug of success heavy in the air punctuated by diamond caviar and ego.  For the first time I was an outsider...  Alessandra Torre writes some of my favorite books.  She can be dark twisty and imaginative and Love Chloe shows what a versatile writer she is.  This is a light funny romantic fastpaced story but with so many clever touches that I enjoyed it immensely.  Each chapter begins with an Instagram picture that were a perfect addition to the story.  They set the tone for the next chapter and what was going on in Chloes life.  This is a standalone novel and it delves not only into the world of New York City socialites but also into the making of a movie AList and BList actors and trying to survive in the Big City.  Chloe has had to grow up fast and complicating things is her old boyfriend who keeps making unwanted appearances in the new life she is trying to make for herself.  Maybe the cultured confident woman I was before was just a product of my parents money.  Maybe now with my new life a train wreck I would discover the real Chloe Madison.  And maybe I wouldnt like her.  Maybe it wasnt too late for me.  Maybe all this was just my wakeup call.  Chloe finally finds an apartment that she can afford on her own now that she is gainfully employed and wouldnt you know it she has a HOT super who just turns out to be a NICE guy on top of all that hotness!!  And of course you know that you will be treated to some SIZZLING sex scenes.  Carter is a total doll and it is obvious he really likes Chloe.  I loved that she was insecure that she really ended up being a hard worker that she did the right thing in the end youll see what I mean and that Alessandra Torre gives her a happy ending that she deserves.  Does she ALWAYS make the right choices?  No.  But Love Chloe is a little sliceoflife very modern book that is immensely enjoyable.  The author continues to surprise with her ability to write across different genres.  If you are looking for a very fastpaced book with humor heart and tons of steam Love Chloe is defintely for you!  I love you Chloe.  Everything else fades away from that.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False

220, .   Stars!  There is so much to love about this book!  The heroine is funny feisty different and not afraid to be herself.  The dialogue is sharp and Graham is devlishly sexy.  The story begins with a creative premise: a lost cellphone on a train.  Our heroine Soraya and Graham immediately clash when she goes to his offices to return his phone.  He is a total asshole at work but he loves that she argues with him and isnt afraid of him at all.  Soraya works for an advice columnist doesnt love her job and has not had a successful sex life.  She rides the train to and from work every day from her apartment in Brooklyn and that is how she first spots Graham.  But these two could not more different!  My life was far from Sex and the City.  It was more like Sex and the Pity.  Or Sex and the Shitty.  There are lots of funny oneliners in this story and the plot is very fastpaced.  Graham loves that Soraya is pierced and dyes the tips of her hair in wild colors.  Different from the stuffy women he has been with in the past.  I loved the major twist in the middle of this book: it injected lots of emotion and heart into this story.  I loved the New York City setting but several unrealistic plot points interefered with my enjoyment of the story.  These authors are wonderful at creating memorable characters and StuckUp Suit is no exception.  The chemistry is explosive and the sexy times are very very hot.  It would be my pleasure to leave the gentleman at the door and fuck you four ways dirty.  This book is perfect if you want a sexy funny fastpaced contemporary romance that offers an escape from reality for a few hours.  And kudos to Ms.  Ward and Ms.  Keeland for creating a heroine who marches to the beat of her own drummer!  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
221,   . STARS!  Sweetly smart romance with a magnificent hockeyplaying hero!  Who wouldnt fall in love with Tucker?  This sexy NA/Sports Romance series was just what I needed to read right now: fastpaced funny light with just the right touch of sweetness and steam.  Tucker was a doll: a good boy who really loved Sabrina and wanted to stand by her no matter what when a surprise pregnancy interrupts their nostringsattached relationship.  Tucker was a fabulous hockey player with a bright future ahead of him but like Sabrina he knows what he wants too and he goes after it.  Sabrina has her goals set in stone: attend Harvard Law and then go on to work in a large prestigious law firm.  She works multiple jobs studies hard and doesnt have much time for anything else.  Her home life is the pits and she cant wait to get far away from her family.  Tucker and Sabrina were perfect together!  The steam factor is off the charts in this book!  Oh sweet baby Jesus.  Sex with Tucker is dirtier and hotter than I thought it would be.  He doesnt look like hed be this way but isnt it always the quiet ones?  Tucker was patient yet a bit stalkerish thank God!  and overall The Goal is another wonderfullywritten story from Elle Kennedy.  And the cover!!  Hello abs!!  The secondary characters are strong and I loved seeing the characters from the earlier books here.  With that said you do not need to have read the earlier books in the series to love and enjoy The Goal.  I loved the message here and the Epilogue was soooo sweet!  Thanks Elle for another sexy couple in the OffCamput Series!  My goal once upon a time was to succeed.

222,   . GRUMPY SEXY STARS!  The massiveness of his body was such a turnon.  He was an unyielding wall of a man.  I just wanted to stay right here  literally pressed between a rock and a hard place.

Sexy funny and smart.  Fabulous beginning to what Im sure will be a fantastic series!  I absolutely loved this story about Griff a superhot and alwaysgrumpy farmer who lives and works with his large family on their farm in Vermont.  I loved the wonderful details about apple farming organic farming and the agricultural business!!  This eye for detail just shows what an incredibly talented writer Sarina Bowen is.  Audrey is struggling to make her mark in the Boston restaurant world and is called upon to visit several farms in Vermont as part of her job.  She runs into Griif with whom she had a few hot hookups in college.  Back then he was a superstar football player but he thought she was a sorority party girl and she thought he would never be interested in someone like her.  Flash forward to the present Audrey is trying to make it on her own without the help of her wealthy mother.  Her bosses arent exactly ethical in their business dealings which Griff makes quite clear to her.  BUT these two have some AMAZINGLY hot chemistry and cant seem to stay away from each other.  I must say that Sarina Bowen surprised me with the heat level in BITTERSWEET!!!  Griff is hot sweet huge and BEARDED.  Audrey is hooked!  But these two could not be more different: Griff is serious usually grumpy and completely immersed in running his farm and the business side of farming while Audrey who is smart and driven is funny outgoing and much more of a people person.  Youre the sweet that balances out my natural tannins.  Griff is my kind of hero.  Hardworking sexy sweet devoted to his family...and when he opens up to Audrey and shows his true feelings OMG!!!  Perfection.  There was nothing I wouldnt have given her at that moment.  Skin to skin with her was the only place I wanted to be.  There is an incredible cast of supporting characters I would love to read a story about each and every one.  BITTERSWEET has humor heat wonderful writing and and a fast paced story.  And plenty of sexy times to satisfy even the most jaded of contemporary romance readers like me!  The only thing that kept this book from being a  star read for me was a scene early on that I felt was out of place in a sexy contemporary romance story.  Other than that I highly recommend this sweet sexy and funny story!!  Cant wait to read the next book in this series!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
223, For good or bad all roads led back to him.  Perhaps thats what it meant to really be his.  I could not.  Put.  This.  Book.  Down.  Simply out this book grabbed me from the beginning and I havent been able to stop thinking about Emily and Reeve since I finished.  FIRST TOUCH is without a doubt one of my favorite books of the year.  It is stunning and a true pageturner!  The plot the pacing the hotterthanhot sex scenes the emotion the characters...all pure perfection.  I love Laurelin Paiges writing but with FIRST TOUCH she has written the best book of her career.  Run dont walk to buy this book!  I absolutely love a damaged heroine when written well.  Emily is an incredibly real thoughtful smart and beautiful woman who lived a very fast and dangerous lifestyle when she was young.  Her partner in crime was her best friend Amber with whom she lost touch but who has now reached out to Emily.  Amber represents a part of Emilys past that shed like to put behind her but Emily is forced into using her beauty and charm once again in order to seduce the man she believes might hold the clues to Ambers whereabouts.  Men were my drug.  Staying away from them had been the only way I knew to stay clean.  The only way to reinvent myself.  Amber has disappeared is somehow in danger and Emily feels she owes it to Amber to help her.  Amber did the same for Emily many times when they were younger and Emily senses that Amber needs her now.  To that end Emily sets her sights on wealthy hotelier Reeve who might be the only link she has to Amber.  Reeve it seems is only interested in a purely sexual arrangement with the alluring Emily.  But Emily cant help but fall for the hot yet emotionally reserved playboy.  His grip was strong and sure and aggressive.  Almost too tight but just barely not.  He held it without saying anything for several seconds and I dont know how somehow though I knew he was making his own allusion.  His own promise.  He wanted me to know what hed be like.  In bed.  With me.  Hed be powerful and controlling and forceful even.  Almost too forceful but just barely not.  Was that how hed been with her?  Did almost become too much?  This book is part erotic romance part thriller part romantic suspense...FIRST TOUCH has it all.  There are some VERY graphic sex scenes in this book and the steam factor is off the charts!!  But there is much more to this story than just the erotic elements.  My heart absolutely ached for the suffering Emily had endured and I was literally holding my breath in anticipation throughout the story hoping against hope that she and Reeve would develop real feelings for each other beyond their agreedupon sexual arrangement.  Emilys pretend seduction of Reeve quickly turns into something more and she knows that Reeve represents the possibility of a real connection real feelings but he is hiding many secrets of his own.  Because the only thing worse than falling under Reeves spell would be me believing that hed fallen under mine as well.  There is a large cast of characters in FIRST TOUCH  some might be dangerous some might not be and some might know what happened to Amber.  One thing is for sure nothing is as it seems in FIRST TOUCH.  And that is what makes this such an outstanding story.  Favorite quote:  This is only today.  Tomorrows going to be something else entirely.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False

225, Slip of the Tongue is absolutely enthralling.  Jessica Hawkins continues to be one of the most underrated contemporary romance authors today.  I ADORED this book!!  I am personally a fan of love triangles in books  I know a little strange but I love the emotion the forbiddenlove aspect and and the thrill of it all.  So if you are not a fan then this book is probably not for you.  Sadie has been married to an amazing man who has suddenly and inexplicably shut down.  Nathan has stopped communicating with Sadie seems to not want her anymore and pretty much just shuts her out.  She tries to get through to him to no avail.  Enter sexy neighbor Finn who is smart sweet and makes his intentions very clear from the start.  I have LOVED this authors writing ever since I read her Cityscape series which I highly recommend.  Ms.  Hawkins made me FEEL Sadies insecurities her inner battles and her fear of losing her husband and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster from the first page of this book.  This is a very adult and very passionate book where not all is blackandwhite.  Yes Nathan seems perfect and yes Sadie makes some mistakes but she is human and I found the story to be very believable.  I loved Finn and could see why Sadie was so conflicted.  She love her husband but feels like her marriage is over.  All of the characters in this book are incredibly well written and I connected with them from the start.  Finn and Sadie have explosive chemistry AND so do Sadie and Nathan!  The sex scenes are absolutely incredible.  I loved everything about this book and loved the conclusion.  Kudos to Jessica Hawkins for another incredibly sexy and addictive story.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
226, Sweet SEXXXY funny...JOCKBLOCKED has all this and more!!  Jen Frederick has a gift for sparkling dialogue and nuanced characters that elevate her books to the top of the sportsromance genre.  This story is funny fastpaced and shows off the authors deep love and knowledge of the sport of football.  Lucy and Matty are adorable and the sex scenes were waaaaay steamier than I expected.  And the banter between these two is priceless!  I know how to cook and have at some points in my life operated an iron.  He ticks off each skill on a finger.  I always bring the good booze when Im invited to a party and I make my bed in the morning.  You had me at know how to cook.  Who doesnt love a gorgeous smart athlete whos also senstive depsite his partyboy reputation?  Matty is one of the authors most endearing characters.  Lucy is hilarious and her inner dialogue is pure gold.  The girls must have spotted Matt because they bypass three open tables to walk by ours.  As they pass theres a contest of who can flip her hair over her shoulder the hardest.  I swear the last two eye fuck him so hard its a wonder they make it to their own table upright.  Theres a very sweet twist to this story and I found the peek into the inner workings of a college football team fascinating.  If you want a wellwritten fresh college romance without unrealistic and unecessary drama pick up JOCKBLOCKED.  It is part of an internconnected series but can defintely be read as a standalone.  And be prepared for Matty to steal your heart!  He watches me while I pull on my coat.  Youre right that theres nothing wrong with how youre living.  Im not judging that.  Im just saying maybe your life could be happier.  And that sometimes taking a risk gives you big rewards.  And youre that big reward?  He smiles wide.  You wont know unless you give me a try.

227, . STARS!!!  WOW!!!!  There are lots of contemporary erotic romances out there but Nikki Sloane has quickly become one of my favorite authors in the genre.  Regan and Silas burn up the pages in THREE DIRTY SECRETS!!!!  Silas is just well irresistible.  A hunky smart artistic and Alpha tattoo artist??  Sign me up.  This isnt the tired old girlmeetsguy girllosesguy girlgetsguy back story.  Regan is working as an undercover FBI agent in the Blindfold Club which is really a side story to the main event of her sizzling romance with Silas Getty.  She is an aggressive cop and Silas is aggressive too so what to do with that?!  Nikki Sloane wraps it all up pretty nicely in this steamy sexy story.  We had heat by the truckload but this was something else.  Passion.  So different and so much better.  Regan is still reeling from a prior undercover operation gone wrong so she is distant with Silas reserved in her emotions but he is passionate and loves that Regan is a toughtalking nononsense woman.  She is afraid of falling for him but quickly that he might just be THE perfect man for her.  Id failed all of my objectives when it came to Silas.. .  and I hadnt outlined any ground rules about keeping things between us casual.  Last Sunday had been anything but casual.  THREE DIRTY SECRETS is as much of a romantic suspense as it is a BDSMthemed book the action is fastpaced and the sex scenes are absolutely incendiary.  This book is for mature readers only!!  There are threesomes that are scorching hot and main characters who are passionate driven and not afraid to take what they want.  I highly recommend this story it is another winner in the Blindfold Club Series!  FAVORITE QUOTE:  My mouth opened but his hand slapped over it silencing me.  His expression was wild like a man pushed to the brink.  He looked dangerous and fucking gorgeous.  I couldnt wait any longer he muttered.  Deal with it.  Beneath his palm I smiled.  Id met my match in Silas hadnt I?  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
228, . Sweet  Steamy Stars!  Cardeno C. is one of my favorite authors.  Her books always contain a perfect mix of spicy and sweet and the heat level is always just perfect for me.  Her stories are always interesting sometimes poignant but never fail to contain a ton of heart so I absolutely love reading them.  This book is the first in a series but can be read as a standalone.  Asher is a dominant cop but this story just touches on BDSM themes nothing too heavy here.  Asher meets a younger man while in Las Vegas for a bachelor party.  Daniel is the COMPLETE opposite of Asher!  Hes a free spirit but he too is very attracted to Asher.  Ashers protective tendencies come to the forefront with Daniel but the problem is Daniel is looking for a relationship and Asher not so much.  I loved seeing how the relationship between these two changed and grew.  AS with all Cardeno C. books the characters are EVERYTHING and Daniel and Asher do not disappoint.  Just look at this gorgeous cover for a hint of the steam level of this story it is a perfect mix of total hotness and sentimental sweetness.  Some readers complained about the stalkerish tendencies of Asher but I didnt get that at all.  He is just a big bear of a man trying to find his way to true love awwwwww!!  Something in the Way He Needs is another perfectly sexy romance from Cardeno C. with just the right touch of emotion and steam!  I loved it.  If you are looking for an author to read with wonderfully satisfying characters and storylines then grab this book!  Youll love it too.

229, Fantastic friendstoenemies story!!  My heart is literally bursting.  Two words: JUSTIN.  BANKS.  I dont know how Penelope Ward does it but she takes someone who is so filled with hate and venom and turns him into the biggest hearthrob on the planet.  Amelia and Justin havent had any contact with each other in years  literally  so she feels compelled to sneak a peek at the man she is going to be owning a house with.  Hes...gorgeous.  Absolutely freaking gorgeous.  Covering my face I said Jesus.  Please dont tell me that.  Take a look.  I cant.  Before I could refuse again Tracy shoved the phone in front of my face.  It shook in my hands as I took it.  Sweet Jesus.  Why did I even look?  Lo and behold Justin shows up to share the summer home with his girlfriend.  Cheating is not a dealbreaker for me but not to worry it doesnt happen here.  Justin is in love with his girlfriend and in hate with Amelia.  And he makes her life absolutely miserable.  Even though I was too stunned to say anything my heart was screaming.  I knew deep down my reaction wasnt just because of my physical attraction to him.  It was because despite all of the changes one thing had stayed exactly the same.  His eyes.  They reflected the same hurt that I remembered from the very last time I saw him.  Justin and Amelia have THE most delicious lovehate relationship throughout much of the story until the real reason for his deepseated hostility comes out.  It is heartbreaking emotional and very sad but he and Amelia make an uneasy truce to continue to share the home that her grandmother left to both of them equally when she passed away.  Will you at least look at me when youre talking to me?  He turned around and walked toward me slowly then leaned his face in.  I could feel his words on my lips when he asked Is this better?  Youd rather me in your face like this?  I could practically taste his breath.  My entire body felt weak from the close contact so I backed away.  I didnt think so he snarled.  There is SO much to this story that cant be given away for fear of major spoilers!  But once again Ms.  Ward has crafted a richlywoven very intense story with beautifully damaged characters who might not ever find their way back together again.  Did I mention the heat factor is off the charts?  Sexy senstive musician anyone?  Hurt me?  He let out a slight angry laugh then shocked me with what he said next.  It changed me.  I loved you Amelia.  I was in love  with you.  Justin ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.  How the fuck did you not know that?  Ah these two.  Living together under one roof becomes almost unbearable.  The this book takes a major turn in the second half of the book which only makes Justin and Amelias story all the more bittersweet.  And the Epilogue!!  GAHHH!!!  Loved.  RoomHate is one of my favorite Penelope Ward books and I already miss these characters!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
230, .   Stars  As much I loved CRAZY GOOD the debut book from this author I am not quite sure what to make of this latest book.  CRAZY GOOD was a sexy refreshing very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author.  Unfortunately TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all.  There is a dramatic totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or setup.  Added to the large number of editing and grammar issues Im afraid this just wasnt for me.  Perhaps some editing next time around will help.  I will definitely give this author a try again but this whole book was just a giant puzzle to me.,3,False
231, My first thoughts upon completing this book MY HEART.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS SERIES IS OVER!!  Another perfect heartstopping story from Kristen Ashley.  This series holds a very special place in my heart because KNIGHT was my very first Kristen Ashley book ever.  I didnt quite fully understand the warning that came along with that book because to me KNIGHT was absolute perfection.  After I then read almost every single book Ms.  Ashley wrote I realized that the Unfinished Heroes Series was a bit different from her other mostlynice all swoony Alpha heroes.  And I adore every single one of her unfinished heroes.  SEBRING was like unwrapping a special gift.  Olivia was a complex heroine damaged and scarred both indies and out having grown up into a crime family.  She trusts no one and for good reason.  Her own family is treacherous immoral and very dangerous.  But yet she cannot escape the life that has been mapped out for her.  She is an obedient daughter following the rules until the night she meets Nick Sebring.  Olivia is closed off to the world and has given up all hopes for a normal life.  Id learned that I didnt allow myself to show emotion.  Ever  I was always fascinated by Nick since he first appeared in KNIGHT.  He has a fascinating back story here investigating Olivias family and targeting her in an effort to infiltrate the Shade family to take down her father.  Nicks first love was caught up in their violent world and became victim of the Shade familys notorious brand of violence.  SEBRING is not a pretty hearts and flowers sweet love story.  Its is gritty raw violent yet amongst all of that Kristen Ashleys trademark goodness and beauty and love shines through.  Nick Sebring himself does not think he can be redeemed but something about Olivia sings to him.  They make the perfect couple really.  They both love a certain brand of kink and tom me are PERFECTLY matched.  There is plenty of heartbreak in this book.  Olivia carries around secrets in her heart that would absolutely break another person.  So it makes her coming together with Nick Sebring even more bittersweet and gorgeous.  And Nick...well I fell in love with him.  Yes the very same Nick Sebring from KNIGHT who caused so much trouble!  SEBRING is everything I love about a Kristen Ashley book: family incredibly hot sex scenes fastpaced action forgiveness and yes love.  I cant recommend this book highly enough.  Happy reading!  Favorite quote:  Im not bawling.  You were close.  You were being sweet.  Like I said get used to that.  Then you were an ass.  You should probably get used to that too.

232, . Stars!  I love picking up a book not having any expectations whatsoever and then being totally swept away and entranced by the story!!  That is what happened with THE BALLER.  What I though would be a standard predictable sports romance turned into a pageturner for me with a sudden and very unexpected twist in the middle of the story!  Delilah is a successful sports journalist another I love about Vi Keeelands books  her heroines are all smart feisty women who is assigned to interview superstar football player Brody Easton.  She has had a bit of a dry spell lately which might just be coming to an end with the entry of Brody into her life.  That man isnt into me.  He wants in to me.  Same thing.  No.  Theres a major difference.  Brody lays his cards out on the table pretty much from the beginning.  From playing a locker room prank on Delilah to pursuing her relentlessly I absolutely loved watching their relationship develop.  But Brody has a major secret he is hiding.  Will it destroy Delilahs trust once she finally lets herself open up to Brody?  I read this book in almost one sitting it was that enjoyable.  I adore Brody he is cocky yet funny sexy yet very very smart and intuitive and very much in tune with what women want.  The story takes a surprising turn which I did NOT see coming and I literally could not tell where the author was going to take this story.  The ending was very satisfying and I highly recommend THE BALLER!!  You will love it.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False

235, . STARS!  Love is friendship set on fire.  I get it now.  AHHHHHH!!!!  Smoking hot sweet SEXXXXY and emotional!!  This book has it all!!  Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy write some of the best new adult romance today and they hit it out of park again or made a goal??  with US.  I fell in love all over again with Jamie Canning and Ryan Wesley.  If you are looking to try a MM story I highly recommend this series.  It is pure romance!  Wes and Jamie are faced with the reallife pressures of a modern couple when Wes travels with his pro team and Jamie begins a job coaching.  Added to the stress of their relationship is that fact that Wes is still hiding his relationship with Jamie.  It pained me to suffer alongside both Wes and Jamie when they could not go public with their relationship.  A sudden devastating illness makes everything very clear to Wes and finally gives these two some of the normalcy that other couples enjoy.  Leave it to these two authors to write an engaging hot funny and very sentimental story that shows the reader that love is for everyone.  I also adored Blake who was funny and a true friend.  Hello he deserves his own book!!  US is a wonderfully romantic and incredibly sexy story about two people in love.  This book will have you cheering laughing clutching your heart and fanning yourself.  What more can you ask for?  Kudos to Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy for another beautiful story in this series.

237, The Shadow is a lush passionate and complex story filled with romance art history and suspense.  I am not a huge fan of paranormal stories but I make an exception for Sylvain Reynards books.  I LOVE the Gabriels Redemption series and Professor Gabriel Emerson makes an appearance here.  What more could you ask for?  William and Raven are reunited in this story but William is battling forces who are trying to sabotage him.  He has finally found the love of his life and he wants nothing more than to worship Raven forever.  I will never have your nobility of spirit or your protective nature but as long as I have your love I can be content.  William will stop at nothing to protect Raven from both other vampires and from those who scheme to drive them apart.  There is lots of action and mystery written in the style that is completely unique to Sylvain Reynard.  This is a very sensual and passionate book and even if you do not usually read paranormal romance you will love this story.  The streets of Florence seem to come alive!  We also learn about Williams early life and the tragic story of how he lost his first love.  Raven is completely trusting of him and along with the intrigue there is also a little humor here too.  Youre giving me a toothache.  He pulled back.  How is that possible?  She laughed.  Its a figure of speech.  It means youre being too sweet.  Say something awful.  Williams expression changed and he brought his lips to her ear.  I want to take you back to the house so I can spread you on my bed and do all kinds of wicked things to you.  I cant wait to see what happens next!  The Shadow is a beautifully written book and my favorite in the Florentine Series so far.  Lush lyrical passionate and very intense.  The outtakes are absolutely fantastic.  Dont miss it!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False

239, Charli Moore I like you.I have since the first time I saw you.  I am a hug fan of Aleatha Romig.  Her Consequences series is an absolute favorite of mine and is one of those series that you cant stop talking about nonstop with anyone wholl listen to your ranting and raving about Tony Rawlings.  I couldnt wait to read BETRAYAL the first in a series of  fulllength novels in the Infidelity series.  Now while cheating does not bother me in the least for those of you who might shy away from such books rest assured thats NOT what this book is about.  At all.  Alexandria has grown up very wealthy and has tried to break free from her extremely dysfunctional family by attending college as far away as possible from her controlling family and wicked stepfather.  After gradating from college she yearns to cut loose and does just that during one week at a resort with her best friend.  She meets a mysterious sexy uberAlpha named Nox and they embark on a passionate and intense nostringsattached week.  She uses the name Charli so that she can remain completely anonymous.  But they will have just one week together even though she clearly develops intense feelings for the stunning Nox.  Our first time will be what you want what you fantasize about.  Im going to take you right here right now.  WOW!!  Their scenes together are richly written and breathtaking and they have tons of chemistry.  I absolutely loved the alternating timeframes which added to overall feeling of tension and foreboding.  There is a completely surprising twist at the end and if you have a few hours then prepare to become completely captivated by the sexy Nox and smart beautiful Alex.  Her family drama back home in Savannah Georgia was a little overthetop for me but does serve to show how far she has come to break away from her controlling family.  This book really brings the story together at the end and it definitely ends on a cliffhanger!  I cant wait to see what happens next for Alex and Nox!,4,False
240, . STARS  Crashed Out is exactly why I LOVE Tessa Baileys books!  Its lusty funny and filled with lots of real emotion and heart.  And an older woman/younger man theme?  YES PLEASE!  I SWOONED over Sarge.  He left town years before as a shy introverted teenager and has now returned to town a rock star.  He has come back to visit his sister and her child and take a break from the pressures of band life.  But even though he is now famous he has never forgotten his older sisters best friend Jasmine.  He has been in love with her since he was young but she never paid much attention to him.  But now...well lets just say things have changed a LOT since Jasmine last laid eyes on Sarge!  But televisionsize and lifesize were two very different things apparently because Sarge had been remodeled from a onestory colonial into a big brick mansion.  Jasmine resists Sarges attention but he pursues her relentlessly thank God.  He is sexy...intense...sensitive...just totally irresistible.  Much of the fun of reading a Tessa Bailey book is the trademark dirty talk and boy does she deliver here.  My word.  Sarge is EVERYTHING!!  And he writes music!!  As for Jasmine I absolutely adored the fact that she was quite a few years older than Sarge and was filled with insecurities.  Why would Sarge be interested in her?  After all he could have anyone he wanted.  But he has never forgotten the girl he left behind and he is bound and determined to make her forget their age difference:  No more fixing me sandwiches.  No more ruffling my goddamn hair.  He reached down and grasped her hand bringing it to the back of his head moving it in a messy circle.  If I ever feel your fingers in my hair again theyd better be pulling my face closer to whatever Im licking.  I also loved how Sarge encouraged Jasmine to pursue her dreams and as with all of Ms.  Baileys stories family plays an important role here.  Crashed Out has turned out to be one of my favorite books by Tessa Bailey.  I cannot wait for more stories in this series.  I highly recommend Crashed Out if you love an ubersexy steamy story with plenty of heart!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
241,   . Stars  I loved this book!!  I am obsessed with Zaal Kostava.  This is a really dark but VERY sexy and enjoyable story.  Reap is filled with passion emotion and heat.  It is most definitely my favorite Tillie Cole book.  The horribly scarred and damaged Zaal absolutely broke my heart.  But his beauty and soul shine through when he finds kindness and yes even love after many tortuous twists and turns.  Although this should read after Raze it is a stunning story and I highly recommend both books.  Talia is a fantastic heroine strong beautiful and compassionate.  Loving Zaal might come with dire consequences but she cannot be without him.  You are my Zaal the man whose soul has stolen mine.

242, . Thrilling Stars!  WOW!!  Spellbinding engrossing and sensual Madame X is a richly detailed story that is filled with mystery and suspense.  Very adult and incredibly sexy this story completely took me by surprise and I cant recommend it highly enough!  The blurb to this book is really just a small part of this story and it is interesting that none of the main characters are mentioned by name in the synopsis.  I had not read any reviews on this one going in so I am going to keep this short.  If you are looking for a very adult very sensual read then Madame X is for you.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of the book and I absolutely fell in love with the male protagonists yes plural and cannot WAIT for the next book!  Your sexuality belongs to me X. No one else may even so much as fucking smell you do you understand me?  You.  Are.  Mine.  There is a touch of BDSM in this book but I believe that more will be revealed on that front in the next story.  There are themes of dominance and control here but I was thrown off guard several times by the direction that this story took.  We are introduced to both Caleb and Logan in this story and while one might seem cruel controlling and calculating I do not believe that all is at seems and that Logan who we meet later in the story will also have many many layers to him.  I dont think there are any real villains or heroes in this book I think?!  I could be very wrong!  and that is the genius of this story.  Sexy explicit fastpaced and very very creative Madame X thrilled me on many levels.  I couldnt put it down!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
243,   . Stars!  WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!  This book picks up from the end of Book  and explores Weston pursuing Mirella.  Please note that this is the second book in a trilogy and most definitely ends with an incredible cliffhanger!  I found this book to be incredibly gripping dealing with a taboo subject in an erotic almost romantic way.  Ms.  Royas writing is charming and playful at times and almost addictive.  I was absolutely fascinated by Weston and Gabe and was kept on the edge of my seat waiting for their marriages and their relationships to crash and burn.  We didnt learn from our mistakes.  We just made them all over again.  I found myself thinking about these characters even when I wasnt reading which to me is the sign of a good book.  Mirella and Weston go back to their arrangement but Mirella lays down the new rule: their relationship is to be only physical with no emotional attachment.  Weston falling in love with her is what got them into trouble the first time around.  I shouldnt have let this all this get so out of control.  This book is still told only from Mirellas POV but it delves more into describing Gabe and Westons feelings.  Bridget however is still very much a mystery.  I would love to know more about her.  In Book  the two couples try to have a normal relationship which does require a suspended sense of reality but I loved the way Ms.  Roya explored the boundaries of their relationships.  I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop here either by Gabe ending the open marriage arrangement or by Weston falling in love with Mirella all over again.  I was not disappointed!  This is an incredibly addictive story and I cant wait for the next book in this trilogy.  I am dying to read more about Gabe and Weston two very passionate sexy characters who each deserve their own book!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False

245, . Passionate Stars!  MAJOR heartache.  MAJOR passion.  And a strong heroine with a painful past!  Im obsessed with Scarlett and Dante!  Love is War is a great description of this second chance loverstoenemies story.  BREAKING HIM was nothing that I expected.  I need the second book yesterday!  I must know more about Scarlett and Dante!  This story has very much of a TristanandDanika feel to it.  The chemistry between Scarlett and Dante is almost so real you can feel it leap off the pages.  Why is Scarlett so ANGRY about everything?  At first her prickly attitude kept me at a distance but once I learned more about her character and her background I absolutely fell in love with her and was rooting for her.  And Dante well he seems like the perfect guy at first and I just know that he will end up doing the right thing.  He and Scarlett MUST be together!  They are meant for each other!!  Do you hear me Author Lady?  The secondary characters are all fantastic and are an integral part of the story.  Ms.  Lilley does a great job of describing the social hierarchy of small town life and how stifling it can be for those who do not fit in.  I literally read this book in one sitting and cannot wait for the continuation of Scarlett and Dantes story.  Ms.  Lilley has once again created an absolutely unforgettable couple whose passion and chemistry burned through every page.  Favorite quote:  I have tormented some sweet men.  Broken hearts and shattered dreams.  Men are punching bags and I have a hell of a right hook.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
246, . Sexy Gritty Stars!  Karina Halle never ceases to amaze with her writing!  She can take a reader from swoony sexy contemporary romance to stories like Dirty Promises a brutal rough gritty and violent story that is incredibly gripping sexy and readable.  Javier Bernal is a cruel man.  Yet I still felt sympathy for him its true!  because if you have taken the journey with this character you will know he is the product of his history and background.  But make no mistake this book is violent and is set in the world of drug cartels.  If you are looking for a different read with fantastic writing then I highly recommend this series.  Javier and Luisa have a marriage that is on the brink of falling apart.  Their story here is an incredibly wild ride and is most definitely NOT for the faint of heart.  But if you are willing to take a risk with your reading then you will be immensely rewarded.  I did not know what to expect with DIRTY PROMISES because I knew this would be a gritty story maybe even more so than the other books in this series.  Karina Halle really delivers the goods with this book and if you are a fan of dark actionpacked stories with a very damaged hero then please read this series.  The books and the characters are unforgettable!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False

248, .   HeartStopping Stars  This book is why I read contemporary romance.  The swoony hero the beautiful sweet heroine who is hiding a tragic secret the explosive passion but most of all the deep and emotional connection I felt for Adam and Evie all added up to a perfect pageturner that kept me up all night.  Adam!!  My heart broke for him and for the love he lost with Evie.  Adam and Evie LOVE the names!  fell in love when they were just teenagers.  Adam did not trust many people so when Evie suddenly disappeared he became even more bitter than he was before.  He spends years searching for her and when he finally finds her his feelings are a mix of rage and heartbreak over their lost years.  Evie refuses to tell him why she disappeared suddenly all those years before so their reunion is bittersweet filled with longing and regret but also undeniable and explosive passion.  WHEN I WAS YOURS is told through a series of flashbacks which put me through every single emotion possible.  The story set against the backdrop off Hollywood and the megarich is more than just a classic rich boy meets poor girl love story.  Its sexy heartfelt and heartbreaking all at once.  The unexpected twist had my heart in my throat and had me silently cheering for our MCs to get their happily ever after.  You cut your hair.  It has been ten years.  I know.  I just...I remember a time when you said youd never cut your hair.  A small smile touches my lips at the memory.  Yeah and I remember when you promised to love me till death do us part.  Shit changes.  My smile drops from my face.  My cheeks sting like hes just slapped me.  I deserved that.  Doesnt stop it from hurting like a bitch though.  Samantha Towle is one of my favorite writers and she absolutely delivered the goods with this story.  The characters and their sweet sexy and passionate love story wont soon be forgotten.

251, How do you describe the feeling that you get when you read a Kristen Ashley book?  It is very hard to describe the emotions in simple words.  Gutwrenching?  Heartpounding?  All of those happen to me and when a book is the end of a beloved series well lets just say that I was a sobbing mess while reading this Epilogue.  I binge read The Burg Series several years ago while on a long vacation that involved a lot of driving.  Needless to say I volunteered to sit in the back seat while on most of this vacation so I could read this fantastic series!  As with all of her books each of Ms.  Ashleys series are slightly different in the Burg the characters are all a little older a lot jaded fiercely protective and above all unforgettable.  HOLD ON is a spectacular end to the series.  Cher appeared earlier in the series a hardluck woman who struggles to keep her head above water and lives paychecktopaycheck to support herself and her beloved son.  She never ever believes that love will happen for her and never ever believes that she will find happiness with a man who will love and cherish her and her son.  Cher broke my heart over and over and I cried many times throughout this book at her sadness and despair.  But hed never give me what I wanted.  I forgot.  I forgot that I wasnt the kind of girl who got what she wanted.  Not once.  Not in my whole fg life.  Yeah Id forgotten that.  Cher has a major case of unrequited love for Garrett Merry who in turn cannot forget the exwife who broke his heart.  Sounds like a real downer of a book right?  But no!  HOLD ON is a tale of mended hearts beautiful possibilities and bright futures that everyone dreams about in their heart of hearts.  There is no one who can infuse a story with magnificence and hope like Ms.  Ashley.  And HOLD ON is the perfect story of love and redemption of fighting for what you want and for holding on when you know you have goodness within your grasp.  The ending of this book very much reminded me of the series finale of one of my favorite TV shows Six Feet Under.  Kristen Ashley is the Queen of epilogues and I will never ever forget this one.  I am so sad to say goodbye to the families of the Burg but I know that Ms.  Ashley has even more goodness in store for her readers.  I cant wait to see what she comes up with next.

The scenes where Lily tries to adapt to life in the city are priceless.  This is a fastpaced laughoutloud classic enemiestolovers story.

253, I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didnt quite do it for me.  I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun which was very disorienting.  While many readers are raving about this book for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical and the story formulaic.  I still would love to read the other books by this author because their story lines sound very intriguing.  Giving credit here for a very strong kickass heroine and a surprising ending.

255, THREE LITTLE MISTAKES is an absolutely perfect erotic romance.  It is pure escapism pure lust and just plain hot.  Have a cold shower ready ladies you will need one after reading this one.  Although this is the third book in a series it is a complete standalone.  The author does an amazing job of giving just the right amount of background on the Blindfold Club and on the characters in this book.  The story is fantastic and the sex scenes...well they are absolutely scorching.  There is a threesome almost a foursome kind of a two  twosome that rivals anything Ive ever read.  And I do love a good menage scene or three!  Em is the classic good girl: shes smart follows the rules but is wealthy in her own right.  Joseph is the owner of the Blindfold Club an elite place where the woman have sex with their clients while blindfolded.  Highend prostitutes but Em doesnt know this side of Josephs business.  She just thinks he is a wealthy club owner who has a very very kinky side and she wants to be very very bad.  Being wrong and bad was just as Id hoped it would be.  It was so so good.  Joseph is a Dom and is several years older than Em.  He is insanely attracted to her innocence and youth and they begin an affair where he will teach her how to be a submissive.  Em is completely different from the other women Joseph has been with and he quickly becomes addicted to her despite there being a million reasons why they shouldnt be together.  Now this might seem like a tired old trope wealthy older worldly guy pursues a young inexperienced girl but this book is SO much more!!  I was addicted from the the first page.  This book has humor witty dialogue a great story and THE most amazing prolonged sex scenes EVER.  Of course things grow complicated and there are many secrets between these two.  Em might be a threat to Josephs business so will he be willing to give that up?  They both push each others boundaries and the conclusion was perfect.  This book is a very explicit very adult story that kept me riveted from beginning to end.  It is a pageturner all the way!  I loved it and cant wait to read the other books in this series!

256,   . Stars!  Two words: Knox Masters!  I really enjoyed this book Jen Frederick is one of my favorite New Adult writers.  Sexy and very engaging Sacked is a fastpaced refreshingly funny story.  Jen Fredericks writing is like a breath of fresh air.  This story is refreshing and verrra sexy while also sweet and funny at the same time.  I LOVED it!  Knox Masters is a college football superstar and Ellie is a transfer student who just might be his perfect match.  Shes smart athletic understands the game of football...but wait shes hiding a secret that could jeopardize both their futures.  And well Knox is a virgin so theres that too.  I often find that New Adult books dont hold enough romance or sexy times for me but SACKED has all of that PLUS MORE.  Its a steamy wellwritten story and it provides very knowing glimpses into the world of American college football.  Plus I absolutely LOVED the witty backandforth between Knox and Ellie!  And the fact that Knox is a virgin well I am usually a Doubting Thomas but this storyline just works.  When he and Ellie finally get together the slowburn build up is totally worth it and the scenes between these two are off the charts hot!  SACKED is a sexy light fastpaced read and it is not just for fans of sports romance.  Theres plenty of humor and a little bit of drama and it all adds up to a terrific read.  Knox Masters could not possibly be any hotter and Im really looking forward to more books about the supporting characters.  I loved SACKED and highly recommend it!

259,   . Enchanting Stars!  Well I certainly love going into a book not knowing what to exepct.  And Graysons Vow took me by surprise.  This is not a typical Mia Sheridan story but it is magical enchanting and irresistible nonetheless.  Two very strong sexy and damaged lead characters make this a very memorable story.  The story begins in a very gripping way: Kira is desperate almost homeless and immediately propositions Grayson Hawthorn with an almostinsane scheme: she must marry in order to gain access to an inheritance from her grandmother.  Grayson too his desperate: he is about to lose his precious winery and has reached a dead end due to his prison record.  Grayson is sexy handsome yet aloof and emotionally closed off.  He has been hurt by those he trusted and loved.  Kira is also emotionally damaged but yet she still remains warm and engaging and filled with hope.  She is young and impulsive but truly believes marrying Grayson is her only hope.  I fell in love with Grayson.  He is cruel to most people but when you learn about his past well your heart will break for him.  And Kira was betrayed by those she trusted most which could have left her cruel and emotionally cutoff but she still retains the capacity to love.  In Vino Veritas.  In wine there is truth.  In love there is truth.  Graysons Vow is set in and around Napa California one of my most favorite places in the world!!  I absolutely loved the scenery and the setting.  There is also an engaging cast of supporting characters in this book which I loved.  There is an air of magic to this book which adds a bit of whimsy and lightens the emotional heaviness of the plot.  There is PLENTY of steam and Grayson is just YUMMY.  Who doesnt love a bad boy with a heart of gold?  This book is very different from Ms.  Sheridans other books and gets into some overlydramatic scenes near the end of the story.  I still found this to be a beautiful story about the power of love and acceptance and honesty.  And the EPILOGUE...OMG!!  A  which had be sobbing happy tears for Grayson and Kira.

260, Well hmmmm.  Although lots of readers raved about this story it just didnt work for me on many levels.  I can live with instalove and instalust but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever.  The storyline is clever and could have made a good book but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations.  There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable.  I give the author credit for some interesting ideas but this book is in need of a good editor.  Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version.  Ill give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not it completely changed the tone of the scene.   Usually I purchase the finished book but I didnt in this case.  So take a look at all the positive reviews and give is one a try if you think its for you!,3,False
261, We didnt always want what was right.  We wanted what we couldnt have.  God this book tore me up!!!  Gutted me.  Enthralled me.  Made me feel anxious sad elated...all at once.  Thank you Tarryn Fisher for this magnificent rollercoaster ride of a book.  I wont ever forget it.  At once magical and painfully realistic FCK LOVE is like nothing youve read before.  It has some similarities to one of alltime favorite series The Love Me With Lies books but it is different unique and wonderfully beautifully hopeful and cynical at the same time.  Can that be?  Tarry Fisher pulls it off with one of the most surprising books Ive ever had the pleasure of reading.  The story begins with a completely disorienting scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book.  Kit hit me out of nowhere.  I had a dream that made me take a closer look at a guy I was otherwise ignoring.  And from that dream I discovered a connection.  I dont even think about the dream anymore.  For the last eight weeks Ive been living it.  Yes the main character Helena has a dream in which she is living a life completely different from her current path.  What will she do with it?  Will her dream become her reality?  In true Tarryn Fisher form the author has created a kind beautiful smart and very quirky girl who aches for what she cannot have.  We have something Helena.  In another life it would have been a beautiful something.  That hurts.  God does it.  Ive seen that life.  He doesnt even know what hes talking about.  In his mind Im just some possibility that could have been but in my mind hes the only possibility.  Fck Love is a wildly unpredictable book that is poignant and uplifting funny and tragic and will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  I cant help but wonder how much of this story if any is based on reallife events.  And yes I imagine Tarryn Fisher herself as Helena.  To me it is a perfect fit!  Dont miss Fck Love it is absolutely one of my favorite books of .  Favorite Quote:  Be gentle with yourself.  Embrace the lows so that you can more effectively enjoy the highs.  Love the fight.  Love it so much and let it save you when your emotional muscles have become soft.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
262, Butterfly Dreams is the first book I have read by A. Meredith Walters.  I know she is a favorite of many readers so I was thrilled to have the chance to read this book.  I adored this story!  It is a witty fastpaced and yes very emotional story about coming to terms with your life and facing your own mortality.  The author has created two very lively and memorable characters in Corin and Beckett.  Corin is obsessed with her physical health convinced that she has a multitude of undiagnosed ailments.  She does suffer from panic attacks but she is sure she is going to die at any minute from a heart attack.  She finds her way to a support group for heart patients where she meets Beckett who has actually suffered a nbearfatal heart attack and has had his regular daytoday activities sharply curtailed.  He is in the prime of his life but because of his brush with death now sees everything differently.  Corin is morbid and morose while Beckett is warm and funny and outgoing.  She looks back on her life while he looks forward:  Stop thinking about your life in increments.  Seconds.  Minutes.  Days.  Look at the bigger picture and embrace whatever time you have.  Dont look constantly toward the end.  Enjoy the right now.  This story is very funny and balances the serious subjects perfectly with witty banter and sexy times between the two main characters.  I really enjoyed this story and recommend it for all fans of New Adult romance.  While the conclusion is a bit predictable the wit sarcasm and solid writing make Butterfly Dreams a very enjoyable read.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
263, . Stars  Classic enemiestolovers romance one that I couldnt put down once I started reading!  Hollywoodsuperstarmeetsordinarygirl is one of my favorite themes and Alessandra Torre serves it up with plenty of sexiness warmth and downhome Southern style.  This is a book that could have gotten bogged down in cliches but in the hands of Alessandra Torre it is a smart funny and very insightful peek into the donwside of Hollywood superstardom.  I absolutely loved the realistic yet loving portrait of smalltown Southern life as painted by Ms.  Torre.  Although the author is quick to state that this is a contemporary romance and is not like her other books there is PLENTY of steam and sexy times in this book!!  Cole is just irresistibile.  And the banter between the hero and heroine is priceless.  And no one writes a smart and sassy heroine quite like Alessandra Torre.  The only quarrel I had with this story is the portrayal of the legal proceedings involving Brad DeLuca.  Meh.  Other than that I loved Hollywood Dirt and found myself with a book hangover after leaving the fictional town of Quincy GA.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
264, I wished I could see myself through his eyes.  Then again Damian never looked at me with his eyes.  He looked at me with his soul.  Totally unexpected story by the incredible Leylah Attar!  Dark and emotional but ultimately passionate and hopeful.  A mustread.  I couldnt put it down and read it almost in one sitting.  After I read  LETTERS FOR MY LOVER I fell in love with Leylah Attars writing.  It is rich mature and lush.  I couldnt wait until her newest book and was completely intrigued by the synopsis for THE PAPER SWAN.  Not much of the plot is given away for good reason.  There is not much I can add to the stellar reviews for this book other than to say that Ms.  Attar has a unique voice and an incredible gift with words.  Nothing prepared me for the emotions that I felt while reading The Paper Swan.  The characters the plot the epilogue  all perfect unique and gloriously realized.  I like a good dark read as much as I love a sexy contemporary romance and this book actually blends these two genres together.  My attention has been wandering as of late and I have struggled to finish a lot of the books I have been reading.  However I read The Paper Swan from cover to cover do Kindles even have covers?  and basically ignored real life until I finished this magnificent story.  I dont know how to describe this story other than to say everyone has some redeeming quality no matter how evil they act and those whom you think are above criticism might have skeletons in their closet and may not be what they seem.  The story is filled with tons of suprising twists along with a stunning story of survival redemption and forgiveness Nothing can prepare you for this story or for the depth of emotion you will feel.  The dialogue is witty and intelligent and the heroine is smart and loving and very capable.  Without giving too much away this is a story about love passion family hate revenge and survival.  And devotion.  We are stars with flaws that still sparkle and shine.  We always strive always want always have more questions than answers but there are moments like these full of magic and contentment when souls get a glimpse of the divine and quite simply lose their breath.  The Paper Swan is one of the most unique books Ive ever read.  Based on the synopsis I went into thinking I was getting one thing but was surprised with what this book was actually about.  There is much more I want to say about this book but its hard to without giving anything away.  This is just one of those books that its better to go into blind.  The fact that you dont know what to expect makes The Paper Swan even better.  I will say that The Paper Swan is an incredibly written book with tons of plot twists and smart characters The story spans a good amount of time and that adds a richness to the relationship between the two main protagonists.  This book is captivating intense sexy and funny all in one book.  I am still thinking about The Paper Swan weeks after I finished.  Simply put The Paper Swan was absolutely amazing.  I cant recommend it highly enough.   fantastic stars!!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False

I want to f you like an animal and a saint.  I want to keep you on the brink for an hour and take four orgasms from you.  I cant do it all tonight.  Im kind of pissed about that.  Hardball is sexy heartfelt exciting funny steamy and addictive.  I LOVED Dash Wallace!  He is seemingly perfect gorgeous a gifted athlete but he is actually filled with compulsions and must adhere to a strict routine at all times.  His baseball career and his sanity depend on it.  I fell totally in love with this damaged man.  The Synopsis to this book doesnt really show the depth of emotion in this book.  There is so much more than just the sizzling romance between Dash and Vivian.  There is the amazingly detailed descriptions of the game of baseball.  There are the wonderful supporting characters including Vivians elderly father.  There is the constant battle within Dashs head over his ADHD and the obsessive way he deals with routine and his superstitions.  Vivian has only had one boyfriend in her life so Dash hits her like a freight train.  OMG their scenes together are on FIRE!!!  CD Reiss writes some of the best erotic romance around.  And set against the backdrop of Los Angeles and baseball well Hardball is just perfection.  I LOVED the imperfection of these characters.  Vivian and Dash are both insecure in their own way.  Vivian doesnt think shes good enough or sexy enough for a glamorous baseball player like Dash.  He is battling with his own internal demons.  These characters captured my heart.  And kudos to CD Reiss for the fabulously detailed descriptions of the game of baseball.  I am a huge fan of CD Reiss but even if youve never read one of her books give Hardball a try.  It is glorious.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
266, . STARS!  Ethan Dexter is SMOKING HOT and sweet as sugar  my favorite combination!  Just say the word and you can have me Fiona.  AS you can read from the synopsis Ethan Dex Dexter is a pro football player who also happens to be a virgin.  The author did an fabulous job with this part of the story it is a romance after all and I totally believed the sweethot feelings that Dex and Fiona had for each other.  First and foremost this is a love story with fantastic steamy sex scenes and perfectly witty and funny banter between the characters.  Dex and Fi met years earlier and he has never forgotten her.  She is a smart and feisty woman who is not so sure she wants to jump into a relationship with a professional football player who also happens to live in an other city.  I loved how Dex practically wore his heart on his sleeve which to me made him all the more irresisitbile.  Ms.  Callihan writes loving sexy men and Dex is no exception.  And the beard tattoos and ahem piercings only added to his allure.  I want you badly enough to put all my cards on the table show who I really am.  So I guess its your play now.  I read this book almost nonstop and adored each and every character!  Dex and Fi went through some difficult times and not all was sunshine and roses for them.  The Game Plan is perfect for when you want a very sexy but light and fastpaced sports romance that will make you laugh out loud and TOTALLY swoon over the storys hero.  I also loved how the author portrayed the trials and tribulations of living life in the public eye and how Dex and Fi dealt with the very public intrusion into their private lives.  Kristen Callihan has quickly become one of my favorite writers.  Enjoy sexy Dex!  Favorite Quote:  Ive been waiting two years for you to see me.

267, . STARS!  Freedom is so close I can taste its bitterness on the tip of my tongue.  What a stunning story!!  I adored this tortured tale of Low and Poesy two starcrossed lovers who spend much of the book on the run from the authorities after a string of bank robberies.  It is a tribute to the talent of Mary Elizabeth that you actually feel tremendous sympathy for Low the poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks whose life seems doomed from the first page.  Low has the misfortune to have a criminal for a father and to be dirtpoor.  A petty crime lands him in prison with hardened criminals who teach him how to rob banks.  When he is released he tries desperately to live on the right side of the law.  But poverty hunger and sheer desperation drive him to a string of crimes with the loyal Poesy right by his side.  She is absolutely devoted to him.  Im here she chose in a forsure tone.  We did this together and anything we do together is right Low.  I spent most of this book on the edge of my seat in a constant state of anxiety for the handsome sad Low and his beautiful Poesy.  He is desperate to live a simple normal life.  Low is not at all greedy but he just wants to be able to eat help Poesy with school and help his own family.  They seem doomed from the start but they overcome so many obstacles that I was cheering for them throughout the book.  LOW is a fastpaced very gritty story that is incredibly addictive.  This was my first book by Mary Elizabeth and I am in love with her writing style!!  I loved LOW and I hope for more about these two unforgettable characters.

268, .   DARK STARS!  Freedom.  I had it.  But then I lost it.  This is Pepper Winters are her VERY darkest very close in tone to the fantastic Monsters in the Dark Series but even darker!!  Be warned that the first half of this book is quite grim and follows the imprisonment of young Tasmin now called Pim at the hands of a sadistic monster.  There is scene after scene of graphic physical abuse along with sexual abuse.  The Indebted Series one of my favorite series ever might not even be as dark as Pennies.  As much as I absolutely adore Q and Jethro I have high hopes for the mysterious and ruthless Elder Prest!!  But dont be fooled he is as blackhearted as they come and explicitly warns Pim that he is no hero.  I wasnt a nice man.  I was a tormentor.  A killer.  A thief.  And I wanted to steal her courage drop by fucking drop.  After all this darkness in Pennies I just KNOW that Pepper Winters will craft an unforgettable romance between Prest and Pim as only she can do.  After all a very wise author told me that you gotta start dark to enjoy the light.  The writing is excellent as always very suspenseful and very descriptive and yet never revealing too much about Prest or about the future storyline.  The ending left me hopeful and wanting more.  I cant wait to finish this dark journey with Prest and Pim!  With thanks to the author for a review copy.,5,False

And we get to visit with some of our favorite Sinners.  I have devoured all of Ms.  Cunnings previous books I mean who doesnt love the megahot rockers of the Sinners on Tour series?  Those were among the first books I read when I started reading romance.  And the new Exodus End book doesnt disappoint in the steam department this book has everything and more in the sexytimes department.  Ms.  Cunning once again writes an immensely readable and incredibly HAWT story this time involving the virginal and very sweet Toni who is hired to write an interactive biography of the band.  Something about her attracts Logan the sexy Mr.  Hot Rocker who actually finds her innocence an incredible turnon!  Their scenes together are um breathtaking and will leave you with a new respect for there writing talents of Olivia Cunning.  There is a very sweet story involving Tonis family life she is leaving behind her special needs sister to go on tour with Exodus End.  Her mother is the owner of publishing company that Toni works for andI loved the tension between her mother and Toni over the company.  There is lots of drama involving a coworker who doest have Tonis best interests at heart.  Our favorite Sinners all make appearances here and it was great meeting up with them again  But the heart of this story is the wonderful sexual awakening of Toni and the hands of Logan I mean Olivia Cunning can write a sex scene like no other!  Toni is very endearing and not your typical flashy sexy groupie that Logan would normally go for.  Their scenes together also have a lot of heart to them.  I adored this first book in the Exodus End series and I cant wait to read about the other band members!  I hope there will be more!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
271, WOW.  Kristen Ashley does it again with Logan and Millies story.  Just when I think I cant love this author any more she takes my breath away with yet another absolutely magnificent book.  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!  I am a HUGE fan of secondchance romance and Walk Through Fire might be one of my alltime favorites in this genre.  Everything I love about Ms.  Ashleys writing is here: an older couple a smart but damaged woman an Alpha male and lots and lots of ridiculously hot sex.  I could go on and on about the gorgeous moments in this book but really you should just read it and experience the emotions for yourself.  I got the same feelings in this book as I did in Soaring and while it takes a lot for me to cry while reading a book I cried plenty while reading Millie and Logans story.  You learn right off the bat that Logan was Millies first true love and that things ended suddenly between them years earlier.  Jump forward and Millie runs into Logan and just the sound of his voice stuns her and she feels compelled to explain to him what happened decades before.  He has been married and had children but Millie has spent the years alone although successful in her business and very close to her own family.  Logan who hasnt seemed to have gotten over Millie walking away from him is still bitter and is very very cruel to Millie when she tries to explain her behavior to him:  Im done not because Im done but because theres nothing left of me to burn.  You have it all!  Youve always had it all!  I gave up everything so you could have it all!  Please!  God!  Leave me to my nothing!  I dont want to spoil the story but you will probably guess Millies reasons for suddenly breaking up with Logan pretty early on in the story.  As bitter as Logan is towards Millie you know that eventually these two will have their HEA but their path there is both beautiful and very bittersweet at the same time.  There is a mature aspect to this story which drew me in from the first page.  These arent kids or twentysomethings these characters are all adults with their own kids careers families and relationships to deal with.  i absolutely loved how Logans exwife was portrayed in this book and how Millie interacted with her.  Oh and did I mention the sex in this book is completely hot??  Because of course you know that it is!!  I dont often reread books but I have already reread parts of Walk Through Fire while I wait not so patiently for the next book from Ms.  Ashley.

272, . Stars!  Lauren Dane writes an supersexy story with a couple who have some piercings in very um key places!  Ms.  Dane has written some of my favorite and sexiest contemporary romance novels The Brown Family series is a favorite and highly recommended  they are totally addictive.  Opening Up is the first in her new Ink and Chrome series.  The plot is light steamy funny fastpaced and pretty much angstfree.  I couldnt wait to dive into this book and I read it one sitting.  PJ is a young strongwilled woman who breaks free from her overbearing family and ventures out on her own in the world off body shop painting.  She meets Asa who is older totally domineering and sexonastick.  He accepts her for who she is and their sex is to put it mildly off the charts.  Think multiple piercings sexy tattoos and passionate car sex!  Youre defiling her in your head right now arent you?  Hell yes.  There is nothing too dramatic or earth shattering in this book.  I loved the chemistry between PJ and Asa and you will need a fan for their scenes together.  OPENING UP is the perfect summertime read to take to the pool or beach and the secondary characters are just as enjoyable!  I cannot wait for Duke Asas friend to get his story in FALLING UNDER coming out in August.  Hello!  Can you say huge tattooed and sexy?  All in all OPENING UP is a passionate funny dirty and light summer read with a HEA.  Enjoy!  Wait.  I want to see you put the condom on over the piercing.  I should know this.  For future reference.  I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.,3,False
273, Sweet and unexpectedly romantic and SEXY!!  I love a story with a single mom and The Offer has that plus much more.  I loved all the characters in this book plus Steph and Lident make appearances as well.  However you do not need to have read The Pact to enjoy this story.  Nicola is living on the edge trying to make a home for her daughter Ava but struggling to make ends meet since Avas dad is absent.  Along comes Bram who seems to be quite the sexy player confident and bold.  But Bram isnt what he seems theres more than meets the eye here and after some amazing chemsitry and hot sex Nicole finds herself falling for Bram.  There is no Instalove here Nicola and Brams banter is great and she does not instantly fall for his moves.  I loved Ava and Ms.  Halle writes the scenes with her with great compassion and understanding.  Ava is adorable.  But sexytalking Bram is the star here and I really liked how he had many different sides to his personality.  This is a classic contemporary romance with modern characters genuine dialogue and very realistic situations.  There is a wonderful Epilogue plus a suprising twist which was all very satisfying.  The Offer is a great summer read full of sexy times great banter and very sympathetic characters.  ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
274, PRIEST is a wonderfully dirty very adult and immensely readable book from Sierra Simone.  EVERYTHING about this story worked for me from the mostly male POV to the smoking hot sex scenes and the very sympathetic characters.  No surprises in the storyline: Father Tyler Bell is tempted by the smart and beautiful Poppy Danforth and they begin a torrid affair that sorely tests his faith and his commitment to the priesthood.  I immediately connected with both of these characters and sympathized with Tylers deep yearning and longing for Poppy:  I was supposed to be a shepherd of the flock not the wolf.  Not the wolf who had woken up this morning grinding his hips into the mattress because hed had a very intense dream with Poppy and her carnal sins in a starring role.  Guilt wormed through me at the memory.  Poor Father Bell!  Everything he worked so hard for was in jeopardy.  I absolutely loved his internal dialogue and the backstory that led him to join the priesthood.  If anyone was ever NOT cut out to take a vow of celibacy it was certainly Tyler Bell but he really loves his parish and congregants.  I also thought the black humor worked really well here as a counterbalance to the fairly serious themes of the book:  I could do this.  There was life after fucking up after all even for those who lived without fucking.  Both Tyler and Poppy realize quickly that they not only can they not keep their hands off each other but they both have very deep feelings for each other.  Tyler truly cared about Poppy and he was risking everything for her.  Their scenes together are just...irresistible!  Was I only telling myself I cared about her spiritual development so that I could be near her?  No I decided.  That for sure wasnt true.  It was just that the actual truth was so much worse.  I cared about her as a person as a soul and I wanted to fuck her and that was the recipe for something much worse than carnal sin.  It was a recipe for falling in love.  PRIEST is an incredibly enjoyable sexy and yes sometimes even funny story.  I plan to read the authors other books because I loved this one so much.  PRIEST is simply outstanding!  Favorite quotes:  Pursue righteousness the author of Timothy said.  But did righteousness carry a bottle of Macallan  in her hand?  Because Poppy did.  Be good be good be good I told myself as I approached her.  Dont jump her bones.  Dont fantasize about fucking her tits.  Be a good priest.

275, Skye Warren is one of my goto dark romance authors.  Each of her stories is richly detailed deeply felt and intensely sexy.  Better When It Hurts is no exception.  Although I have not read Love the Way You Lie I was able to jump right in to Blue and Lolas story here.  Both are very damaged characters who had to learn how to survive on their own from a young age.  These two have a long past together which is why Blue insists on acting as security on the nights she dances at the club where they both work.  Lola tries to put on a tough exterior but her toughness is just an act that is in part driven by guilt over what happened between the two of them when they were foster kids.  This is a gritty story but as with all Skye Warren books the sex scenes are totally hot and very very intense.  Lola is not always the most likable character but she is very real and just trying to do what she has to in order to survive.  Blue is totally Alpha sexy domineering and despite the hard exterior is a guy with a heart.  These two have incredible chemistry.  If you like grittier stories with lots of erotic scenes and the right touch of romance then Better When It Hurts is for you!  Another great story from Skye Warren.

276, . SMOKING Hot Stars!  HIM is a totally sexy story mixed with the perfect amount of sweet passionate romance.  Wes and Jamie are absolutely delicious together.  Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy have become two of my favorite authors!  I read a fair amount of M/M romance books so I approached HIM with a wary eye.  Would it have enough steam for me?  Would the two heroes only dance around their attraction for each other but never really get down to business?  Would the dialogue be witty enough to hold my pathetically short attention span?  The answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!  Because I adored Elle Kennedys Off Campus series and loved Sarina Bowens The Shameless Hour I was thrilled to be able to read their collaboration together.  And once I started reading HIM I literally could NOT put this book down!  Jamie Canning and Ryan Wes Wesley were perfectly real characters to me and the writing style so seamless that I could not tell which author wrote which chapter scene or verse.  Even if youre new to the M/M genre I highly recommend this book for the witty banter sexy times and catchy plot.  Two hot hockey players?  Yes please!  Jamie and Wes were childhood friends who lost touch after a youthful incident that caused an unfortunate miscommunication.  Lo and behold they run into each other years later and both realize that they have been the missing link in each others lives.  But does Jamie just want to be friends with Wes?  Set among the world of college hockey HIM delivers the perfect amount of hot dirty sweet emotion as both Wes and Jamie learn to come to terms with their true feelings.  Wes has always loved Jamie and finds it difficult to keep their relationship platonic.  As I watch Jamie Canning stop another dizzying slap shot.  As I admire the grace and deadly precision with which he moves.  My weakness is him.  I absolutely LOVED how the authors wrote a seamless story that perfectly illustrated the difficulties that gay sports players must face.  Wes and Jamie were perfectly suited for each other even if Jamie at first was reluctant to admit his true feelings for Wes.  And Wes on the other hand is a total commitmentphone never allowing anyone to get too close and hopping from meaningless encounter to another.  The fact that hed been the first guy I ever loved and the one who made me face some terrifying things about myself...well all that will go unsaid.  HIM is a feelgood sports romance that happens to feature two fabulously sexy male protagonists.  It is perfect for diehard readers of M/M romance as well as for readers who are new to the genre.  I adored this book and hope that Sarina Bowen and Elle Kennedy collaborate on many more books in the future!  I received an ARC in return for an honest review.,5,False
277, SMOKING hot funny and surprisingly endearing!  Elle Kennedy writes the wittiest banter around.  I really loved this story and Dean is absolutely irresistible!  The Score follows two characters from Elles earlier books.  Allie is a drama major and Dean is studying law.  Allie may be my favorite Elle Kennedy heroine so far!  She is smart funny and yes emotional.  At first I thought she was a little weak coming off of her breakup with her boyfriend but this girl knows what she wants and isnt afraid to go after it!  And DEAN...well lets just say he started off with a bang for me literally plus I am one of those readers who loves a cocky guy!  Dean comes from a wealthy family and he has certain expectations placed on him...what courses hell study what profession hell go into...his whole life is mapped out for him.  But he is HILARIOUS hello Twilight reference?  and on top of his sexiness he is a sweet caring guy.  When he started coaching the kids hockey team... well lets just say I was a goner at that point.  Oh and did I mention Dean is a dirtytalker?  YES PLEASE!  I though you said you didnt want to salsa dance.  And Dean De Laurentis only does what he wants remember?  He shrugs.  I am doing what I want.  My eyebrows knit together as I wait for him to clarify.  Im making you happy.  Allie and Dean seem mismatched but guess what they fit together perfectly!  Whats starts off as a sexwithnostrings relationship of course turns into much more...but that is the beauty of Elle Kennedys writing.  There is nothing predictable here and there are tons of twists and turns along the way to Dean and Allies HEA.  With lots of witty banter and funny dialogue smokinghot sex and a little angst THE SCORE is a fresh and modern romance that I devoured.

Although Book  in Tessa Baileys Broke and Beautiful series this scorching book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel and is sexy FUNNY and fastpaced.  MAKE ME is pure Tess Bailey gold!  Abby and Russells story is an enjoyable delicious book written as always in the trademark Tess Bailey style of dirtytalking Alphas with a healthy dose of reality humor and solid storyline.  I was hooked from the hilarious opening line of this book.  Russell is a bluecollar construction worker who thinks he will never be good enough for Abby who comes from a wealthy family but is insanely attracted to Russell.  She doesnt quite know how to move their friendship to the next level.  Russell on the other hand fantasizes constantly about the irresistible Abby and is driven by the need to protect her.

280, .   Stars!  I really liked FLAME!  The storyline and the love scenes and the action scenes are all fantastic!  Dakota finds herself taking a road trip with friends while she is on a break from school.  Dakota goes along with Levi Gunner and Emmy Sue on a trip for Levi and Gunners motocross bike races.  Levi is HOT but Dakota stays away from relationships.  So this trip is perfect for the both of them: a hot hookup with no promise of anything permanent.  I loved Dakotas character: she is smart strongwilled and not afraid to go after what she wants But when the road trip ends will she be able to walk away from Levi?  Dakota is from an unconventional family and I love how her free spirit shines through in this book.  Levi is immediately attracted to her spirit but he is very honest about not wanting anything more than sex while they are on the road.  He doesnt do relationships either.  But is he ever HOT!  Sunshine Levi leans over to me resting his hand on the inside of my thigh right below the frayed hem of my shorts I promise I want to learn all about your family.

281, Fresh light sexy and funny!  I absolutely adore R.S.  Greys books.  She has a fresh wit a wonderful way with banter and can write sexy times as well as the best erotica author.  This book is pure fun a feelgood sexy read with a HEA and a Cinderella feel to the story.  It is a modern tale of a smalltown girl trying to make it in the Big Apple living on a shoestring budget but trying in the best MaryTylerMoore fashion to make it on her own.  Jo is a scrappy heroine and thrilled to land her dream job with a famous fashion house in New York City.  Of course her boss is Mr.  Sexy Julian Lefray and the sparks fly between these two right from the getup.  I love a good male POV and Ms.  Grey writes a great one!  Plus this book has the just right amount of sex it was a great palate cleanser in between the supersteamy and graphic contemporary romance and erotic books I normally read.  This book is great if you are looking for a fun light sexy and witty book with great banter between the hero and heroine and some really funny dialogue.  It is a modern tale of love and sex and firendship in the big city and I highly recommend it.  You cant go wrong with a book by R.S.  Grey!

282, Cat Porter has written a magical intense sexy and incredibly satisfying story.  Boner made my heart race and captured my soul!  You reminded me that theres still magic he whispered roughly.  That there are things of wonder still left to experience.  I am a HUGE fan of MC Romance books and Cat Porter is at the top of my list of favorite authors in this genre!  Lock  Key the first book in this series remains one of my alltime favorite books.  Random  Rare contented the experience of her absolutely flawless writing and now we have the third book in the series which is Boner and Jills story.  Boner is a total badass who has been attracted to Jill for a long time but wont act on it.  Hes too old for her she isnt sure she wants to go back to club life again etc.  etc.  Jill had been with Catch another biker and the father of her child and it ended badly.  But who can resist Boner the sexy biker with a painful past?  And how he got his road name...well youll have to read for yourself!  Its not what you think.  I fell in love with him and hoped that Jill could help him overcome his demons.  Was I only pieces patched together by a leather vest?  Even though Boner think Jill is offlimits he offers her his protection and lets just say things progress from there.  At first their relationship is just for show but since this is a romance after all they both quickly come to realize they have real feelings for each other.  And the Victorias Secret scene?  Oh my God!!!  My favorite.  I loved reading about Boners painful past and the action scenes are fantastic.  While this doesnt knock out Lock  Key as one of my alltime favorite books it is a fantastic sexy fastpaced and passionate story which I enjoyed immensely.  The Epilogue was superb!

283, Together we flew and together we drifted down to earth to his bed his room this world this life.  Ending still with Coert and me.  Yes it was glorious.  I dont know how she does it but Kristen Ashley has written yet another sparkling gem of a story.  Emotional heartwarming sexy and heartbreaking this book has EVERYTHING I love.  Theres a toughtalking overprotective Alpha a sweet and steely but damaged heroine and lots and lots of family goodness.  There is nothing like a good oldfashioned secondchance romance as only KA can do it!  The Magadalene series is one of my favorites and while this book can be read as a standalone I HIGHLY recommend reading the other books in the series!!  They are GOLDEN.  Set in a beautiful Maine town I thoroughly enjoyed the detailed descriptions of architecture seasons local food of course and the tightknit bond of the local townspeople.  This book launches right into the reasons why Cady has moved to town: she purchased the crumbling lighthouse because not only does her estranged brother live nearby but the love of her life Coert is the sheriff.  She is determined to make amends with both of them.  But Coert makes it VERY clear right from the beginning that she is to stay away from him at all costs.  What happened between them all those years ago to make him so bitter?  And exactly how and why has Cady changed so much from the young rebellious girl she once was?  Cady and Coerts epic love began many years before in Colorado.  Cady ran with a wild crowd and her family did not approve of her choices or her lifestyle.  But Cady was always selfsufficient and independent and worked long hours at a deadend job just to make ends meet.  She wanted a better life for herself.  She doesnt meet Coert under the best of circumstances but their love was real.  A terrible turn of events tears them apart and just like that the only beautiful thing Cady had was gone.  Cady and Coert then spend many years apart.  When they meet again in Magdalene they both have huge misconceptions about each other.  But they are both older and wiser and hopefully wont make the same mistakes again.  I absolutely LOVED how Kristen Ashley brought these two together again and I was literally sobbing reading much of this book.  The story is long it is weighty and it is hugely satisfying.  I was in love with Coert Yeager in a way that it just simply would never die.  This glorious story features cameo appearances by characters from the Rock Chick series yay!  and it is filled with light and love and hope and smoking hot romance.  Grab a bottle of wine settle in and enjoy the ride!!  Thanks again to Ms.  Ashley for another unforgettable secondchance romance.  This is life.  And in all thats happened in mine the one thing Ive learned is as ugly as it gets as bad as you mess up if you keep going itll get good again.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,5,False
284, . stars interesting idea that had some exciting moments but overall I had a few issues that interfered with my enjoyment of the story.  I did like the main characters and the New York setting.  The writing is very good but I felt the story completely sugarcoated the jail setting this is a fairytale romanticized view of prison life.  I also felt the ending was unrealistic with respect to Carter dealing with a corporate matter I dont want to give away any spoilers here.  Most readers would not be bothered by that turn of events but I had a tough time with it.  I did really appreciate the development of the characters and the overall story idea.  I had high hopes for this book and for that reason I will definitely give the authors next books a try.,4,False
285, WOW!!  Another passionate loving and emotional book from Mara White!!  I had the great pleasure of reading an early copy of Maldeamores and I havent stopped thinking about it.  Heed the warnings on this one because Maldeamores is unlike amy book Ive read.  Belen and Luciano are starcrossed lovers fiercely in love but forced to deny their true feelings for each other.  Like Maras other books I felt anxious emotional distraught and fascinated by these two characters and their tumultuous journey.  The writing is stunning sharp and incredibly erotic and the characters richly detailed.  I was drawn into their world and was stunned by the turn of the events.  These two are truly lovesick and simply cannot live apart from each other.  There are some very graphic and steamy scenes in this book but they fit in with the story and add fuel to the deep emotional bond Belen and Luciano share.  If you like to be challenged and thrilled when you read then Maldeamores is the book for you.  It is not an easy story but I loved the rollercoaster ride of emotions!  Mara White is a talent to watch and I hope she will keep on writing these complex sexy stories.  When the pen falls into our hands we cant erase the past.  All were allowed is the chance to create a new ending.,5,False

287, . Stars!  Parallel universes?  Yes please!  I have always been intrigued with stories about the path not taken.  The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies Sliding Doors.  While this book was not all that I had hoped for it is nonetheless a wellwritten thoughtprovoking story about the consequences of our actions fate and destiny.  Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there and that our choices lead us to our own realities.  Both parallel stories in this book were engaging REAL and very original.  The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others.  I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else led me to someone else.  And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didnt end up with you.  Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths as does her best friend Gabby.  I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book which happily was replaced by joy by the end.  MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book which will make you think about your choices in life and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives.  Is everything all mapped out occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be?  Theres lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book.  I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book.  However much of this story seems aimed at twentysomethings who will very much enjoy Hannahs journey.  I did feel that some important details were missing but overall both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh.  I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the authors other books now.  Love loss family friendship loyalty  they are all covered here and I think this is the perfect summertime read.,3,False
288,  Sexy and Edgy Stars!  Even the best of us isnt purely good.  And even the worst of us isnt purely evil.  This book is pure PERFECTION.  My thought when finishing was Now what do I read?!  This is one of my top favorite series EVER.  I am truly obsessed with this author and this story.  Jonah and Vivienne are incredibly written characters filled with depth and raw emotion.  This is a very adult story dealing with very adult subjects.  With that said these book are among the most highly erotic stories I have ever read.  This series is not for everyone but if you like sexy edgy mature stories then definitely give these books a try.  Lilah Paces writing captivated me and drew me into Jonah and Viviennes story like very few authors can do.  While the subject may seem very taboo I found these books to be as much an exploration of womens sexuality as they are forbidden erotic romance.  These stories take you on an emotional journey that is sensual enthralling and addictive to say the least.  BEGGING FOR IT is the conclusion to the series and picks up right where the first book ended.  They must be read in order.  These two characters are absolutely unforgettable and I could not really fathom how they were going to make their very unorthodox relationship work.  Jonah struggles with his own seeminglyinsurmountable dark fantasies while Vivienne also struggles to come to terms with her own deepseated fears as well as her very dysfunctional family.  I literally raced through this book fearful that the author was not going to give these two perfectly damaged souls the conclusion they were worthy of.  I felt tremendous empathy for both of these characters and was deeply satisfied with the fantastic conclusion to their stories.  I cant say enough about these books.  They are thoughtprovoking emotional and incredibly readable.  We dont get better we dont fix everything thats broken.  We just learn how to work around the broken bits.  How to do the best we can with what we have and who we are.  I am completely OBSESSED with this author and cannot wait for whatever books she might have planned for the future.  I hope there are more books under the name Lilah Pace  I will read anything she writes!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
289, WOW!!  I dont even know where to begin with this book.  Lilah Pace has written an absolutely perfect story filled with erotic moments thrills emotion and a gripping plot.  Each and every character is perfectly drawn richly detailed and essential to the story.  I cant say enough about this book and the author stalking has already begun.  Who is this Lilah Pace and why has she enthralled me so?  Vivienne is an art student at the University of Texas  Austin who has rape fantasies but they are rooted in a traumatic past event and the many sessions with her therapist bring the story to light and perfectly frame the rest of the book.  While some readers might be turned off by this story I found it to be sexy dramatic and addictive.  She meets Dr.  Jonah Marks a gorgeous brilliant and enigmatic professor in another department at UT and through a series of very thrilling events they begin a series of encounters.  Certainly relationship might be too strong a word for what they do.  But I can guarantee that you have never read scenes as hot as the scenes between Jonah and Vivi.  How did this man with the power to terrify me also become the one person who truly makes me feel safe?  They do reach a certain level of intimacy which is very beautiful and poignant all at once.  Both Jonah and Vivi are richly written characters very damaged for sure.  There is nothing superficial about anything in this book and I was also absolutely entranced by the detail with which the author described the various settings in the book.  From Austin to New Orleans there is a level and richness of detail here that is greatly appreciated by this reader.  Jonah doesnt know me well enough to know that Im always ready to protect myself.  My guard is always up.  Still I like that he always considers my safety even in the maddened heat of our mutual fever.  I highlighted a zillion passages in this book and I cant possibly include them all here.  Asking for It blew me away and is without a doubt one of my top reads of the year.  Run dont walk to read this book.  Dont let the blurb scare you away there is so much more to this book and I need the next book NOW!!!  Congratulations Lilah Pace on a magnificent story.,5,False
290, loved this book!  Sarina Bowen is a new author to me and this is the first book I have read in the Ivy Years Series.  It is a standalone but now I am a huge fan so I plan to read the other books in this series.  Bella is a strong heroine and Rafe is totally swoon worthy.  In this story he is the virginal one and Bella is the one who enjoys sex and is not afraid to be the bold one.  Hpw refreshing!  The Shameless Hour is funny sexy and heartbreaking all at once.  Sarina takes some serious themes and incorporates them seamlessly into her story but gives her characters a fantastic HEA.  Rafe is a hot soccer player who catches Bellas eye but who is inexperienced with women.  He is a hardworking student from a closeknit family quite the opposite of Bella.  He is a wonderful character who is honest trustworthy and gorgeous.  But he doesnt just want a onenight stand with Bella.  Bellas enthusiasm had obliterated all of my caution.  She wanted me.  And I could no longer think of any reason why I couldnt have this.  Bella is a surprisingly strong and funny heroine who is not afraid to be herself and is unapologetic about her sexuality.  She is funny and sexy and I absolutely loved her!  Sarina Bowen writes a memorable female character who has grit backbone and smarts.

291, . Stars!!  John Logan.  sigh Absolutely adored this book!  The Deal was a total surprise for me and was one of my favorite books of  so far.  It was fresh sexy smart and funny and I was soooo excited when I heard Elle Kennedy was writing a story about John Logan!  I have been immersed in college romances lately and The Mistake is now another one of my favorites in this genre.  Sure not every college or college experience is like the setting of this story but I adored the characters and their friends well excerpt for one and their struggles to find themselves in what to me is also a great coming of age story.  John Logan is absolutely Book Boyfriend material!  Swoon!!  I fell in love with him as he tried to win Grace over.  Ms.  Kennedys writing style is sexy fastpaced heartwarming and very funny and this book was like unwrapping a delicious treat.  I loved reading about the characters backstories and loved the fabulous ending to this book.  The Mistake was a flirty steamy and fast read and I am now an even bigger fan of Elle Kennedys writing.  I loved this book and I think everyone at some point in their life has experienced some if not all of the emotions that these characters experienced.  The Mistake is another winner from Elle Kennedy!  Favorite quote and I had many!!  Were the Lorris crime syndicate.  Im dumbfounded.  Oh my God.  Lorris?  As in Logan and Morris?  They fucking Brangelinad themselves?  ARC provided by the author with thanks.,4,False
292, Well this is a book that has some controversy surrounding it of which I was blissfully unaware until I read a warning that came with this ARC.  There are lots of reviewers who refuse to read this book and thats fine.  But based on its merits I enjoyed this MM romance that comes with a healthy dose of sarcasm.  Black Balled is a fairly quick read and is a parody of the indie book world pairing a snarky book reviewer with tons of anxieties with an author who has tons of anger issues.  The authors did a great job at the dual POV and really when you peel away the layers of sarcasm and humor the story is about finding yourself.  Larson knows who he is and he makes no excuses or apologies for it.  He wears his flaws just as proudly as he does his attributes for all to see and for everyone to accept or rejectas the case may be because it makes no difference to him.  He is comfortable in his own skin.  That is probably because Larson is genuine.  He doesnt wear layers of facades that need to be ripped away in order to find his inner soul or his truth.  He just puts it all out there without reservation.  Not like me.  There is lots and lots of whitehot sex in this book and tons of great banter.  If you go into Black Balled knowing it has a very different storyline and that both characters have a wicked sense of humor then youll love this book!,4,False
293, I love Chelle Bliss and was so excited to read her newest series!  If youve read Men of Inked then you will fall head over heels in love with Morgan NICE NAME!!  DeLuca a Gallo cousin and Alpha male extraordinaire.  He is just out of the Army and looking for direction in life when he gets an offer from his Florida cousins to join the ALFA PI agency.  He picks up and leaves Chicago and his meddling mother to start over again with a new job.  I loved how the Gallo family is woven into this story.  If you havent read Chelles Men of Ink series you are missing out!  They are filled with love big families snappy banter and lots and lots of mindblowing sexy times.  Get right on that!  Sinful Intent is a fastpaced steamy story involving Morgans first job investigating and protecting his first client Race True from harassing and threatening emails that have escalated.  She is being blackmailed and he must find her tormenter.  She is a buttonedup straightlaced corporate type sexy but basically married to her job and she needs someone like Morgan in her life to add the spontaneity she has been sorely missing out on.  Chelles books are steamy entertaining and have some of the most creative sex scenes I have ever read.  Morgan is just WOW.  Race and Morgan together are just explosive.  I liked the suspense and mystery along with the funny moments sprinkled throughout the book.  I really enjoyed this book.  It is overall a very enjoyable sexy story and a great start to a new series by one of my favorite authors.  Favorite Quotes:  We all have scars.  Some we can see and others we cant.  Wear those with pride.  In all honesty I hadnt saved Race True.  Shed saved me.  Giving me a life full of love and everything Id always needed but never knew Id wanted.

294, . Stars!  Ella Frank has written another sexy gripping and characterdriven book with TRUST!  Are you new to the M/M genre?  Then I highly recommend this series because the story is really about two people loving each other and fighting the same battles with family work and external forces as everyone else.  Oh and theres some supersteamy sexy times to thrill you as well!  Logan and Tate have both changed and grown in this fantastic series.  His motto of try take and top had changed.  Oh hed tried Tate all right and theyd both done a helluva lot of taking but for once in his life Logan didnt feel the desire to win.  He didnt need to come out on top.  What he wanted was Tates trusthis absolute trust.  Logan and Tate have made great strides in their relationship but Tate is still holding back.  He and Logan are in love yes but is that always enough to sustain a long happy and healthy relationship?  Ella Tates wonderful writing style kept the story flowing until the end and there are some dramatic surprises in store for our gorgeous heroes which kept my heart racing until the very end!  Once the calm after the storm had settled Logan moved up his body and Tate wrapped his arms around him.  As they both lay there in the silence of the room neither one of them said a word because really there was nothing to add to such perfection.  I highly recommend this series to all fans of contemporary romance.  The story is enthralling and the characters memorable.  And I absolutely adored the wonderful and satisfying ending for the sexy Logan and Tate.  No Logan finally said and Tate felt his heart sink.  Ill never see you that way again.  Because before this I didnt know you were essential for me to feel alive.,4,False
295, I kept my eyes closed.  I couldnt bear for him to see what mine must look like.  Desperate.  Yearning.  Drowning in agony.  Yearning and desperation.  Two feelings perfectly conveyed by the author in Deep Blue Eternity.  I cant stop thinking about this book!  A beautifully written haunting story of two very lost souls Natasha Boyd also injects some muchneeded humor and a whole lot of sexy into this magnificent book.  Livvy has run away to her grandmothers old island cottage and is quite shocked to find a caretaker named Tom living there.  They begin a tentative and uneasy living situation but of course there is much more than meets the eye here.  They are both frightened in their own way both trying to escape brutal and heartbreaking pasts off the coast of South Carolina.  Both are harbouring some very very sad secrets and both are seeking healing maybe in each others arms.  But Tom pushes Livvy away she is very young and he cannot tell her why he is keeping her at a distance.  I mean I thought we had a... a friendship or something and I dont understand what Ive done wrong.  Addressing it made a weird emotional bubble grow in my chest and my eyes started to sting.  Livvy tries to begin a new life by finding a job at a local cafe and befriending the residents.  But Tom battles his true feelings for her and settles on a friendship as well as protecting her from the local bad boys.  Lifting my arms tentatively I slid them around his waist.  I thought I felt him shudder.  His muscles were bunched tight or he was tense.  I didnt know.  He was hugging me.  I could hug him back right?  This book tackles some highly sensitive subjects which are handled with great care and sensitivity by Ms.  Boyd.  This is a moody sexy very emotional story that is perfectly written and entrancing.  Do not miss Deep Blue Eternity!  It is one of my favorite reads so far this year.,5,False
296, . Emotionally Stunning Stars!  He was my truth.  Even if that made me a sinner.  I expect nothing less than total perfection from Penelope Ward and she delivers another very sexy very emotionally satisfying story with Sins of Sevin.  This book is the perfect cure for any kind of book slump you might be in.  The characters are all richly written the story is very different and creative and the emotions this book inspires will have you wishing you there was more to this story.  I did not want it to end!  Sins of Sevin told in alternating POVs is about a fundamentally Christian household where the daughters must be courted before marriage by a man who has been chosen by the family.  No kissing no touching no NOTHING before marriage.  The problem is that Sevin is promised to a girl he does not love.  His heart belongs to another.  There are many factors at play here as to why he cannot be with the one he loves his true soul mate and these obstacles only make Sevin to be an even stronger heartbreaking hero than is already is.  You cant choose love.  It chooses you and once that happens it doesnt let you go.  You can pretend its not there but when you try it only fights harder...louder...until you finally get the message and give in.  I do not read many other taboo romance books other than Penelope Ward.  She is the Queen bar none of the forbidden romance genre.  Sins of Sevin is another fantastic forbidden romance with a hero that I fell in love with from the first page.  This book is filled with lots of anguish emotion and plenty of guilt on the part of both main characters but the writing in this book flows so beautifully that even the most cynical reader with fall in love with Sevin and MAYBE Evangeline!  Ms.  Wards story spans several years in time which adds to the richness of the story.  I honestly could not tell where this story was going end up and the ending truly did surprise me.  And please have plenty of tissues handy for the Epilogue to this beautifully sexy and very loving book.  I have so much love inside of me thats all yours and its been trapped inside.  I need to give it to you because holding it in is killing me.  I know your heart belongs to me.  But Im selfish.  I want all of you.  I want you.  Sevin and Evangeline are far from perfect.  Both make choices that I did not agree with.  But I absolutely fell in love with Sevin and with this story.  Do not miss it.  Sins of Sevin is a mustread!

297, We loved Mickey and Amelias story!  Soaring is classic Kristen Ashley filled with love family a helluva sexy Alpha hero and lots more love.  What is different about Soaring is that Amelia is far from perfect.  She is a seriously flawed heroine who has made some very bad choices in her life.  Those actions have had serious consequences including the loss of the custody of her children.  But she is bound and determined to change her life get her kids back and maybe just maybe fall in love again.  Ms.  Ashley fills Amelias house with good friends and lots of family.  Fences are mended and hearts are repaired along the way.  But it is not an easy path as Amelia has alienated most of her family and must hide her shattered heart in order to put things right again.  We absolutely loved how the author really nailed what its like to live with teenagers and loved the scenes with Amelias kids and Mickeys kids as well.  Mickey has also had a rough past and resists falling for his gorgeous neighbor.  He is a good man and might be one of our favorite KA heroes ever.  Strong sexy lowkey....yes please!!  And he accepts Amelia for who she is and doesnt judge her based on her past behavior.  The mistakes we make in life dont define us Amy.  The way we handle em after makin em do.  This is an EPIC love story.  We soared right along with Amelia and Mickey.  We also loved how Amelia finally for the first time in her life stands on her own two feet and stands up to her awful lowlife exhusband Conrad.  And she does so without harming her children along the way.  We love a strong heroine and Amelia turns out to be just that.  Smart beautiful and loving it was a pleasure reading about a heroine who was over  and had LIVED a life.  Soaring is a gritty sexy beautiful story.  Dont miss this one!  Life isnt always beauty he returned.  Most of the time its shit.  But you keep fightin to turn it around that says it all about you.  And youre fightin.  As a fighter too I fuckin love that in you.,5,False
298, Misconduct is one of my favorite books of the year!!  Sexy engaging intelligent and inventive Misconduct is why I read contemporary romance.  There are very few books I would read twice and Misconduct is one of them.  I want to thank Ms.  Douglas for writing an exciting very adult contemporary romance that hits all the high notes.  Misconduct was a pure pleasure to read from the welldrawn characters to the New Orleans setting to the damaged family relationships that were the center of this book.  This book is one of my top favorites of the year and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you like to get lost in a book then Misconduct is for you.  The sexy sultry New Orleans setting the smart successful handsome yet damaged hero the beautiful but skittish heroine all of these add up to an unputdownable story.  This book is very different from the Fall Away series except for the unparalleled writing.  This story is for adults it is erotic sexy poignant exciting and thrilling.  What more could you ask for in a book?  Tyler and Easton are two of the standout main characters that I have read this year.  And I have read a LOT.  I read an early paperback copy so I dogeared almost every single page of my copy!!  Heres a peek:  I should go home.  But he kept wanting me.  He kept tapping at my shell like I was an egg he needed to crack.  And while I constantly felt like goo that would spill everywhere if not protected by my hard outer armor he made me feel like I didnt need it.  Exceptional writing an exciting fastpaced story all the right emotions ... this book has it all.  And THE most important factor for me when reading is a connection to the main characters.  I felt a deep connection not only with Tyler and Easton but felt THEIR connection and their love.  Put Misconduct on your mustread list.  It is an outstanding story!  With many thanks to the publisher for an ARC of Misconduct in return for an honest review.,5,False
299, I dont think theres been a book by Cardeno C. that I have not loved.  Home Again is another sexy and sweet story where family is first the characters get their HEA and the sex is SMOKING hot.  This book is told is a series of flashbacks which alternate with present day focusing on Noah and Clark who first meet when they are teenagers.  I love how this author spotlights the importance of friends who accept you but also being true to yourself.  There is some angst in this book but you just know the main characters will work everything out.  The story is clever and the alternating POVs are refreshing.  Oh and of course the chemistry between Noah and Clark is offthecharts hot and the sex scenes are absolutely amazing.  Loved the twist at the end!  This is a standalone although it is part of a series.  If you are looking for sexysweet M/M romance then Cardeno C. is your goto author and you will love Home Again.

300, I do LOVE my Katy Evans books!!  MANWHORE  was a wonderful and very satisfying sequel to the first book in the series Manwhore!  I loved the very modern and witty yet very sexy story.  This book picks up right after the conclusion to MANWHORE.  Rachel has publicly embarrassed her boyfriend Malcolm Saint and is in deep despair of ever repairing their relationship.  Katy Evans writes a beautifully flowing yet very fastpaced and verrrrry sexy story here as we experience the deep heartache that Rachel feels.  This is what Ive been waiting for for four weeks.  This is what I wanted when I left a thousand messages on his phones and what I wanted when I wrote a thousand others that I left unsent.  To see him.  For him to want to see me.  Theres plenty of office drama too as Rachels dream job seems to be in jeopardy due to a bidding war over the ownership of the company where she works.  One of the things I love about this author is that her heroes no matter how tortured always have the ability the love deeply and Saint is no exception.  Despite his reputation he really cares deeply for Rachel and their scenes together are perfect.  I definitely recommend this series if you love a contemporary witty and passionate story with a great cast of supporting players.  I also loved that there might be another story here for Gina and Tahoe?  Things seem to be pointing in that direction and I would love to read more about them!  I cant wait to see whats next for Rachel and Saint and am anxiously awaiting Ms.  Manwhore!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
301, . STARS!  Dragging my hand over my face I pull my phone back out and try to focus on the man I need to beat.  And I think of that nice girl who doesnt want to be nice.  A girl who wants to be unforgettable and doesnt realize she already is.  MAVERICK!!!!  I think Im in LOVE.  Katy Evans has created a gorgeous sensitive beast of a man.  Another legend is born.  Legend is the kind of Katy Evans book that I love filled with passion emotion tons of sexy times and a deep emotional connection between the two main characters.  This book goes back to the roots of the series an lonely underdog fighting against the world and a sweet kind woman who is swept away by his passion.  Maverick the Avenger Cage is an outcast in the underground fighting world.  But he knows he can be the best if only someone would give him a chance and train with him.  The best he can do is a downandout trainer named Oz.  Reese is Remys wife Brookes cousin and is traveling with them on the fighting circuit while taking care of their son Racer.  She is a loner shy and never thinks someone like Maverick would be interested in her.  I wanted to be understood and I wanted to be known.  And I wanted to be loved.  I LOVE a good underdog story and Legend fits the bill perfectly.  There are no overthetop characters here just two people who are searching for something that they never had.  And when Maverick and Reese get together WOW!!!!  Hello new favorite book boyfriend!  Dont go after her if you dont think you can deserve her.  He hits me again and I block then jab him.  He eases back and prowls around.  So do I.  Deserve her first.  Then go after her.  Reese and Maverick have a forbidden romance at first because Maverick is in training to ultimately fight Remington Riptide Tate and challenge him for the championship.  And nothing will stand in his way.  But the truth comes out and Reese must decide whose corner she is really in.  Theres no question that Maverick is all hers and he is the kind of man that knows when he has found the woman for him.  I loved that Reese is not perfect and the author makes sure to point out her insecurities.  This is the kind of book that Katy Evans does best filled with fierce warmth hotness and a brute of a hero with a heart of gold.  Maverick is EVERYTHING.  I adored Legend and it is the perfect entry in the REAL series of books.  Favorite quote:  He doesnt say a word to me but I can feel him.  Hes all I feel.  Everywhere.

302, . sexyAlpha stars!  Harper Sloan keeps getting better and better!  I loved this book!  The author has created more characters to fall in love with.  Cohen and Dani are absolutely irresistible and their story was steamy emotional passionate and beautiful.  This story has the perfect blend of sexy heartwarming funny and tension.  I read this book in one sitting and really feel that it is one of Harpers best books.  Dani is a sweet girl and knows from an early age that Cohen is her man.  The problem is her overprotective Alpha father kept her almost locked away and she never thought that Cohen saw her as anything but the best friends little sister.  I loved that she really was honest with Cohen she didnt try and hide her feelings.  That was a refreshing twist for me.  Cohen is another gorgeous sexy Alpha as only Harper Sloan can create.  He is brave loving and will do anything to protect his girl.  He never forgot Dani or gave up on them even when he was in the middle of combat.  Right in the middle of that Hellonearth chaos I would hear her words trail through my thoughts right when I needed an extra push of strength or God forbid hope.  I think that was the moment that I realized the enormity of it and that confession whispered all those years ago.  Right or wrong whatever it is between us would always be bigger than I understand.  Its something that was so unexpected that feeling craving desire to make her mine.  Its something Ive almost felt guilty about over the years.  Unexpected Fate is a thrilling totally sexy story filled with family love and emotion.  I highly recommend it for all fans of Harper Sloan and for anyone who loves a fastpaced steamy story.  This story has a fabulous and satisfying ending and I cant wait for more books in this series!  ARC received from the the author in return for an honest review,5,False
303, .   Sexy  Sweet Stars!  Hello Elle Kennedy!  Thank you for this perfect blend of sexy sweet and funny!  The Deal is a palate cleanser the kind of book that is a refreshing change of pace from dark angsty overemotional stories.  Even if you are not usually a fan of college romances take a chance on The Deal you wont be disappointed.  Hannah is a smart hardworking selfsufficient music major talented and unfortunately very closed off to any sort of interpersonal relationships.  Garrett is a hockey player Hello!!  New favorite sport!   and a player in every other sense of the word.  He is required to maintain a certain GPA to play on the team and for this he needs a topnotch tutor for one of his classes.  Enter Hannah.  Excerpt that she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with Garrett.  There is so much more to Garrett than meets the eye.  I loved how he slowly breaks down Hannahs resistance and she discovers to her total surprise that he is actually an incredibly decent and yes very irresistible guy.  The Deal is a wonderfully layered story with the characters getting to know one another and slowly developing a bond.  There are no contrived situations here or overthetop plot developments.  The story is pure gold and I absolutely loved every single word of it!  There was only one oops moment in this story which hopefully wont reappear in The Mistake  American college students dont use meters to describe measurements  they would use feet.  There are also fabulous supporting characters here and I cant wait for their stories.  Elle Kennedy has become a new favorite of mine and I look forward to reading more from her.  Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Deal:  I have to say this is the first time a girls been worried about getting caught in my bedroom.  Normally they strut out like theyve just bagged Brad Pitt.  Hannah takes a breath.  We studied.  We watched TV.  I went home late.  Thats what happened.  Got it?  I fight back laughter.  As you wish.  Did you really just Princess Bride me?  Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?  She glowers.  I burst into the locker room and   Penises!  Sweet Jesus.  Penises everywhere.  Horror slams into me as I register what Im seeing.  Oh God.  Ive stumbled onto a penis convention.  Big penises and small penises and fat penises and penisshaped penises.  It doesnt matter which direction I move my head because everywhere I look I see penises.  ARC provided with thanks for an honest review.,5,False

305, .   stars!  I absolutely loved this passionate and moody story and I need closure on Kes and Aimees story like yesterday!  I cant stop thinking about these characters.  This is one of those very broody very memorable stories that really gets under your skin.  The first half of this book completely swept me away and immersed me into the smalltown Midwestern setting.  Kestrel and Aimee had a simmering sizzling attraction that grew from their close friendship as children.  Kes a bruised and battered soul found something in Aimee that he could cling to and that would give him a glimmer of hope in his stolen youth.  Kes was put to work in a traveling carnival at a young age and while Aimee sees the carnival as a magical almost mystical lifestyle Kes sees the much harsher side of carnie life.  His carnival returns to her small town each summer for  weeks and their unlikely friendship blossoms over the years into a sexy heated fullblown relationship.  Fate was against us.  Screw that!  Kes was moody and difficult brilliant and beautiful.  He scared me and protected me.  Years pass and finally Kes and Aimee might have the chance as adults to explore their searing and unbreakable bond.  Kes has becom a star within the fair circuit with women throwing themselves at him as they did when he was younger.  Aimee is a schoolteacher living a safe and plain existence in a town in New England.  What will happen when they are reunited?  He was everything i wasnt but somehow together there was a synergy an alignment something that just made sense.  The first half of this book literlly blew me away!  I could not put it down.  The tone changed slightly in the second half but yet I am still  invested in this story and I cannot wait to see what the author has in store for these characters in the next book!  Please note that this is book  in a series with somewhat of a sudden ending but I highly recommend it.  Prepare to fall in love with Kes!

306, . STARS  What an amazing story!!  Lust sex chemistry and tons of action fill Mel and Painters story.  Never a dull moment here and the sex is OFF.  THE.  CHARTS.  Theres lots of MC goodness because there is a fantastic epilogue PLUS other treats in store for readers of Reapers Fall!  I ADORE Joanna Wyldes writing.  She writes MC romance with a certain excitement but also realism that is absolutely addictive.  Every one of her men is rough sexy and real.  Reapers Fall is Painter and Melanies story and uses one of my favorite tropes the loverstoenemies theme.  Their early contact is really limited to just letters while Painter is in prison.  The buildup is slow and delicious and when they break apart as you know that they will it is emotional and heartbreaking and fiery.  I literally devour every book by Joanna Wylde and Reapers Fall was no different.  Although the characters from previous books appear here this book can abaolutely be read as a standalone but I LOVED seeing all of my old friends.  These books are rouch they are messy there is not always hearts and flowers.  Melanie doesnt always make the right decisions but what I love about Ms W writing is that her characters are always trying to better themselves and Melanie is no different.  And Painter makes no apologies for who he is and when he and Melanie get together it is pure heat and emotion.  Melanie is very stubborn and rebels against the MC.  The actions of the club members are not sugarcoated here but that makes Melanie and Painters journey that much more bittersweet.  And did I mention theres plenty of humor here to balance out the raw passion and emotion and incredibly steamy sex?  If I had to fall in love with an asshole at least he was a hot asshole.  I will read every single book that Joanna Wylde writes.  Every story from Ms.  Wylde delivers the goods.  And as an added bonus here there is a FANTASTIC Epilogue!!  I cant wait for the next book from this fabulous author.  Favorite Quote:  I still wanted better for her.  Someone nice whod work a steady job maybe take her to Hawaii every other year.  Wash her car on Saturday mornings.  Unfortunately every time I tried to picture the guy he was dead at my feet.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
307, There is nothing like the thrill of a new MC book from Joanna Wylde.  Her characters feel real and each book is raw sexy and fresh.  Silver Bastard is no different it is a thrillride from beginning to end.  I fell in love with the two main characters and I absolutely adored Becca she is a kickass heroine who is fighting for a better life and does so with humor and strength.  We first met Puck in Reapers Stand and now it is five years later as Puck is out of prison after taking the fall for his MC.  His first night of freedom and he meets Becca in an awkward situation that turns ugly very fast.  Puck is a standup guy and he basically saves Beccas life.  Several years later Becca is living in a small town in Northern Idaho working and attending school.  She is only  but is much older than her years.  Becca knows that Puck is not the right guys for her she has been trying to avoid trouble since she left home  years before.  But the problem is that Puck cant stay away from Becca and feels protective of her in every sense.  They fight they argue they battle but this book is so filled with humor and fastpaced action that the classic willtheywont they feels fresh and new and exciting.  I couldnt put this book down!  Silver Bastard is one of my favorite Joanna Wylde books and I have read them all.  Puck cant stay away from Becca and he is an Alpha MC biker so... you can guess where things lead.  Joanna Wyldes incredibly steamy scenes between Puck and Becca and the fantastic storyline kept me hooked from the very beginning.  I cant say enough about her writing and her MC books.  Although there are many serious and dark issues raised in this book our hero and heroine eventually get their HEA of course and the funny and witty dialogue provided a welcome relief from all the drama.  I love all Joanna Wyldes characters and I was excited to see some other characters introduced here.  As usual I cant wait for her next book.  If you love great writing with tons of steamy scenes and some rough and gritty drama then you will love Silver Bastard.  Favorite Quote: because this perfectly captured Puck and Becca:  Weve been in a relationship for five years now Puck said his voice hard.  It wasnt normal it wasnt exclusive... Hell I dont know what the fuck it was but we both know thats the truth.  Whatevers between us its been there since the first night we met.

308, do not read much paranormal romance but I highly recommend this book!  The characters and the story won me over.  Mitch and Frederick are twins and both alpha wolves.  Mitch stayed in their area even after his brother found a mate and even though he accepted that he would forever be alone.  Frederick and Simon meet by chance and once again Cardeno C.  s incredibly loving warm and sweet style took over to give these two the full life they had both been missing.  Blue Mountain is a fairly short story but is a wonderful sweet addition to the authors work.  Although Simon and Frederick are only really together towards the end of the story the story and the characters really mesh perfectly together and I loved the direction the story took.  I absolutely adored the narrator of this audiobook even though I liked him best as the voice for Frederick and Mitch.  I would like to hear Sean Crisden again as the narrator in future audiobooks.  I highly recommend this story and the audio book for any reader of the m/m genre even those new to the shapeshifter genre.  Thank you Cardeno C. for broadening my reading horizons once again!

309, . Stars!  Swoon!!!  Ladies and gentleman meet Gray Grayson and prepare to fall in LOVE!  THE FRIEND ZONE is a superfunny very steamy and very romantic sports romance that I absolutely adored.  It can be read as a standalone although two characters from The HookUp make appearances here.  If you are looking for a fastpaced clever story then THE FRIEND ZONE is for you.  I think one of my favorite quotes of the year so far has to be from this book:  Im trying to commiserate you noodle.  Because the itching was torture when it grew back.  And do not get me started on the pain of waxing.  I was certain that evil woman had ripped my lady lips off.  Lady lips?  Oh Christ.  His gleeful laughter echoes through the stadium.  This is so not funny I protest my hands on my hips as his abs clenchwhich unfand he cracks up.  It was the worst pain of my life.  And Ive broken my arm in two places.  Lady lips!  I love it!  But the story is great and the supporting characters all vital to the story and just as interesting as Gray and Ivy.  Ivy has vowed never to do casual hookups especially with an athlete.  Her sportsagent fathers lifestyle turned her off to that.  And Gray isnt interested in a monogamous relationship until of course he meets Ivy.  This book is extremely clever and the author creates a real and meaningful friendship between Ivy and Gray.  Their relationship is believable sweet and honest and so their eventual sexy times did not feel rushed at all but instead felt like a perfectly natural progression of their growing passion.  And speaking of sex did I mention that Gray is irresistible?  Yep perfect boyfriend material.  The nighttime stadium scene?  I died a little.  Hes an intelligent and incredibly gifted athlete with a bright future ahead if only he can withstand his sorry excuse for a family.  To me its a cathedral.  I sit here and I feel calm centered.  And yet its like all the energy of games past remains coursing through my veins and I cant wait for the next game.  These two are meant for each other its just that they dont quite realize it at the beginning:  His forearm tenses and I find him staring at me with wide eyes.  Pain resides there and a sort of longing too.  I recognize it in myself  that need to have someone understand how empty life can feel as if youre the only one in your universe.  Gray holds my gaze for another second then clears his throat.  Shit Mac youre going to have me bawling like a baby soon.  He gives me a lopsided smile.  Ivy and Gray care deeply for each other they both had sad and lonely lives when they were younger some of which has spilled over into their young adult lives and which has brought them closer together.  But never fear the author watches over your heart and doesnt let anything too painful happen to it.  Gray falls for ivy despite his surprise at the depth of his feelings for her.  It was actually quite beautiful to watch his feelings unfold  And that strange dichotomy is my Ivy.  Insane planner mixed with a free spirit who goes with the flow.  A surge of affection hits me and I sink further into the pillows.  Lest I forget to rave about the sexy times they are HAWT!!  Take one  football player who weighs well over  pounds with a dropdead body and a very sensitive and loving soul and you have the recipe for PERFECT sex!  And they both like to act out fantasies.  THUD.  There are some very serious and sensitive moments in The Friend Zone but they are handled with sensitivity and grace by the author.  And the Epilogue was perfect!  Not completely unexpected but tender and loving nonetheless.,4,False

311, Always You is a surprisingly good secondchance romance that is modern witty steamy and filled with believable characters.  This is a great debut from Stephanie Rose!  I loved the story and absolutely loved the plot.  This is an emotional story that grabbed me from the first page.  Samantha is stuck in a loveless and heartless marriage and reconnects via Facebook with Lucas her former college advisor.  It is clear from the outset that Sam is with the wrong guy in more ways than one.  Her husband Marc is an absentee husband and father.  Lucas is wonderful to Sam and her daughter Bella and Lucas and Bellas relationship makes up much of the heart of this story it is just amazing.  Lucas is well irresistible.  He is smart ubersexy respectful and HOT.  Just what Sam needs.  And when things with Marc take a nasty turn Lucas is right there with Sam supporting her emotionally and ready to love Bella and Sam forever.  Lucas is an amazing character and a perfect book boyfriend!!  There are some really romantic scenes in Always You that touched me and melted my heart.  As you can probably see Sam was married when she first reconnects with Lucas but trust me Marc is a horrible person who needed to be dealt with.  Sam just didnt have to courage to act until Lucas came into the picture.  There is lots of sexy time and sweet and sexy texting between our Hero and heroine.  This book was surprisingly hot very readable and enjoyable for all fans of steamy contemporary romance.  The last scenes in the book were especially touching.  I highly recommend this book for romance fans who like some steam to go along with their HEA.  ARC provided by the author with thanks.,4,False
312, . Stars!  Silas and Charlies epic journey continues!  Im a huge fan of this series and Part  did not disappoint!  Another fantastically thrilling and creative story from Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher.  Never forget Charlie.  Never stop.  NEVER NEVER PART TWO is another completely gripping and thrilling story that continues literally from where Part One left off.  The characters continue to enthrall and the plot continues to thicken in the second installment of this very strange tale.  Ms.  Hoover and Ms.  Fisher are two of my favorite authors so it is no surprise that I loved this book and read it in just one sitting.  The feeling of disorientation continued in this story and I could not wait to see where Silas and Charlies journey would go.  Alas... more questions are raised and only a few answers are revealed.  To me this is not a paranormal story even though there are elements of what might be the supernatural here.  I was very surprised by the turn of events here and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next story.  We again have both POVs which flowed perfectly and added to my enjoyment of the book.  Leave it to these two authors to both grip my heartstrings with Silas and Charlies story and leave me feeling like I stepped off a rollercoaster ride all at the same time.  As you can see these books are not standalones but if you like a twisty thrilling beautifullywritten story then dont miss Never Never.  I absolutely adore this series and need the conclusion like NOW!,4,False
313, Someone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people.  Were all just people who sometimes do bad things.  That stuck with me because its so true.  Weve all got a little bit of good and evil in us.  IT ENDS WITH US is one of THE most important books youll read this year maybe ever.  It is absolutely stunning.  There are very few books that I recommend to my daughter to read but this book is one of them.  This story should be read by every woman husband boyfriend son and brother because it contains one of the most powerful messages I have ever experienced.  On the surface this book is the story of Lily who has escaped to Boston from the small town she grew up in.  Smart and driven she opens her own shop and meets Ryle a funny handsome and brilliant surgeon.  Revealing anything more about this book would do a tremendous disservice to the perfect way that Colleen Hoover has told this story.  It builds slowly bit by bit to a painful and inevitable conclusion that took my breath away.  As with all Colleen Hoovers books IT ENDS WITH US is a stunner magnificently written and absolutely unputdownable.  My heart almost stopped in several places.  Its that good!!  Do yourself a favor and read this book  you will never forget it.  Fifteen seconds.  Thats all it takes to completely change everything about a person.  Fifteen seconds that well never get back.

Karina Halle hits another home run with this incredibly engaging and modern tale of dating love and romance.  This is a fun fastpaced and very enjoyable read and a little bit of a different type of book for this author.  And I loved every word.  Linden and Stephanie are two incredibly engaging characters both very endearing and sometimes maddening and in the end just plain human with all the insecurities longings and sometimesdysfunctional relationships that most of us deal with into our adulthood.  These two are best friends but also find each other irresistible.  But they are terrified of ruing their close friendship by becoming involved romantically.  So they make a pact.  At Lindens suggestion they agree at age  that if they are not married by the age of  then they will marry each other.  Sounds like a good idea no?  But the problem is that no one else can measure up to the other during all the years in between.  At times I just wanted to scream Get together already!!

315, ARC provided by the author for an honest review.    . Stars!  I absolutely loved Fighting Silence!  Till Page is a memorable character that I wont soon forget!  Struggling against dirtpoor poverty absentee parents and an inevitable loss of his hearing this book pulled at my heartstrings and thrilled me from beginning to end.  Till is a fighter taking care of his younger brothers to keep them out of the social services system.  His only bright spot in an otherwise dismal existence is his neighbor Eliza Reynolds who he spends every minute with after school but who he completely ignores during the day.  She is just a gorgeous person inside and out and Till is frightened of ruining their relationship with sex so... they spend part of the book battling their attraction to each other.  Eliza was a crier.  She pretended that it was only when she was mad.  That was bullshit though.  She cried every time the wind blew north.  Happy sad angryit didnt matter.  I loved it when she happy cried.  I laughed when she angry cried.  I was gutted when she sad cried.  Id held her through all of them.  But her reaction that night was extraordinary.  I guessed my present was pretty extraordinary too though.  Eliza is sensitive but strong.  I loved that about her character!  This is not a typical fighter story it is fresh and new and make no mistake Till and Doodle BURN up the pages when they get together.  This story is told in alternating POVs and flashes forward in time but Aly Martinez does an amazing job with the alternating voices.  This is a story of true devotion fighting for happiness and fighting for the right to love and be loved.  Sounds sappy but this book is so much more!  I loved it!  Till and I both knew we had a strange relationship.  It was more than a friendship but there wasnt romance or sex.  There was definitely love though.  Immeasurable amounts of it.  I knew that Till had this grand fantasy about me.  But what he didnt realized was all that he gave me in return.  He was the only thing Id ever had that I honestly thought I couldnt live without.  Till Page was my soulmate on every level.,4,False
316, . stars!  This was my first book by Monica Murphy and it was brilliant!  It exceeded all expectations and I am anxiously awaiting the next book in this series.  Sexy adult erotic this book has it all.  Owning Violet introduces us to three sisters born to wealth raised to succeed ready to love destined to make waves.  As the daughters of the scion of a worldfamous fragrance company it brought Estee Lauder to mind Violet and her sisters are all very different but all intimately entwined with the future of their familys company.  Violet at first seems like a pushover and a doormat her boyfriend almost openly cheats on her but she looks the other way all in the name of the company.  But I found her to be a compelling character driven eager to love and be loved and above all very ambitious.  This book literally has it all: highly erotic sex scenes an Alpha male and lots and lots of edgeofyour seat drama.  Ryder is a sexy badboy coworker who rose above his rough past to work in corporate America.  Violet may appear to have it all but she experienced a terrible trauma that is still haunting her to this day.  While we might first see her as nothing more than a pawn in a rather sick game between Ryder and Pilar a scheming woman who wants to bring her down she is much much more that that.  Violet is no pawn and slowly begins to realize that the sexual relationship she has with Ryder might be much much more and she must find her inner strength to beat Pilar at her own game.  Owning Violet is an adult erotic steamy book and I loved the story and the amazingly intense scenes with her and Ryder.  He is hot as hell damaged sexy smart and ambitious.  The steam factor was just genius.  All in all I loved this book and cant wait to read more from this author.  I recommend this for anyone who loves a sexuallycharged fastpaced storyline with some very memorable characters.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
317, . STUNNING STARS!  You make hell feel like heaven Blaire.  WOW!!!!  This series is one of the most readable series out there.  Mia Asher is why I read contemporary romance.  From the first page to the every last word I was hooked invested in the story and emotionally connected to the characters.  If you have read the first book EASY VIRTUE then you know that Blaire is then between two men Ronan and Lawrence.  Who will win her heart?  Will either of them?  Tonight I let a man f my brains out so he could eradicate a different man from my heart.  Ive done it before but this time it didnt work.  Ronan was everywhere.  In every kiss and every touch.  He still is.  Ronan and Lawrence.  Two irresistible men both owning part of Blaires heart but in different ways.  I cant decide which one I loved more the author did an outstanding job creating two men who both stole my heart.  Although Blaire and Lawrences relationship was originally based on an arrangement for sex only he became someone who Blaire could really fall in love with.  But theres Ronan always Ronan on her mind and in her heart.  Ronan has become embittered jaded and filled with hate for Blaire.  But the fantastic way in which the author tells the story here in multiple POVs had me racing through the story to see where it would end up.  I did not want poor Ronan to be so bitter!  He tries to erase Blaire from his mind but she is always there.  When my lips touch hers  she closes her eyes and gives in to the kiss.  I dont.  I cant.  And I fking hate myself for it because even though Im kissing this woman its Blaire who I taste.  I absolutely LOVED the conclusion to this story.  It is rare for me to love a sequel as much as the first book but SWEETEST VENOM is pure gold.  I applaud Mia Asher for the ending she gave to her characters here and dare I even hope that there could be more books with some of these characters?  I will never forget Blaire Ronan and Lawrence.  Theres the stubborn streak that I love so much.  But be careful or it will be your downfall.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False

319, Life happened and then happened some more and kept happening until you were so caught up in life itself that you forgot to actually live it.  What a raw beautiful and unflinching look into the world of the one percenters!  This is NOT a pretty story  it is filled with lust and mayhem and violence  but it perfectly tells the story of Evas parents Preacher and Wheels Debbie.  This is one of my top favorite series EVER and I highly recommend reading the books in order.  BUT you can read the first book right away to get a flavor for Madeline Sheehans writing.  Preacher lived an entire lifetime before we ever met Eva as a young child in Undeniable.  His life was hard.  But he was a survivor.  Prison had been a painful wakeup call for Preacher.  It had taken the man hed been beaten the holy hell out of him flushed him down the shitter and sputtered and spit him back out a ravaged and shameful shell.  Preacher met Debbie on the road.  She too was a survivor and did what she had to do to get by on the streets.  Madeline Sheehan took two very damaged and hardened souls and created something beautiful which is why I absolutely love her writing style.  The book is told as a flashback as Preacher lays dying in the hospital.  He is finally telling his story to his beloved daughter Eva.  But everything I thought I knew about Preacher and Debbie was wrong!  Preachers tale is heartbreaking but I could not put this book down.  I had to see it thought to the end.  Preacher was in the biker life no matter what.  Loyal and true to his family and biker brothers no matter what he was a Demon through and through.  According to the law and the state of New York he was indeed a free man.  But in reality he wasnt free at all.  He belonged to the Silver Demons body and soul for better or worse.  And if he stayed on this path this wasnt going to be the last time he went to prison.  Heartwrenching and gritty Undeserving is nonetheless an incredibly readable story.  It must be experienced.  Madeline Sheehan does not write heartsandflowers stories.  But her biker romances are mustreads.  While this wasnt as raw as Undeniable it is still one of the best examples of this genre.  I cant wait for more books from Ms.  Sheehan.  She is one of my autobuy authors.  Favorite quote:  I noticed you.  Debbies eyes darted back inside the cart colliding with Preachers.  I noticed you.  Those three words took flight finding and nudging awake long hidden places inside of her.,4,False
320, . stars!  Abbi Glines books are a guilty pleasure for me.  I love the Southern charm the sexy boys and the beautiful sweet girls.  When Youre Back is the second book in Reese and Mases story and other characters from my other favorite books all make appearances here.  I loved River Captain Kipling!  This guy is SEXY and broody.  He is a bit mysterious and I am really looking forward to reading more about him!  I can change your world too sweetheart.  But Ill wait my turn.  We also have Mases cousin Aida here who gives the cold shoulder to sweet loving Reese.  I really liked how Reese blossomed in this book and how loving and devoted Mase is to her.  He is one of my favorite of Abbi Glines characters and he is definitely book boyfriend material.  Their scenes are touching sexy and sweet just what I expect from the Rosemary Beach series.  I liked this book and recommend it if you are looking for a sexy quick summertime read!,4,False
321, Crying!!  From laughter.  This book would make a great movie!  Alice Clayton writes funny.  sexy adult romantic comedies.  Theres plenty of steam and always just the right amount of emotional tension to deliver a good light satisfying read.  Mai Taid Up is the story of Chloe and Lucas.  This is a standalone and although Chloe was mentioned in Screwdrivered you do not need to read the previous books!  You can dive right in and you will enjoy the story.  Chloe is a runaway bride and realizes that she was not in love with her fiancee.  Much to the horror of her very proper family she picks up and moves away to begin a whole new chapter in her life.  Her passion is reuse animals and she opens a rescue center for pit bulls.  And that brings her to the handsome veterinarian in town Lucas.  The two begin a flirtation and and Chloe really begins to fall for Lucas.  I mean who wouldnt?  A sexy vet?  Hello!  I loved their scenes together and their relationship was a slowbuild.  There is one thing that Lucas cant stand and when he finds out about Chloes almosttrip to the altar things blow up.  I absolutely loved how independent and feisty Chloe was.  She is no wallflower!  Shes smart and no pushover.  Often heroines can be kind of a door mat but not Chloe.  And there are plenty of really funny moments in this book to go along with the swoony romance.  Overall I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a fresh fun and breezy read.  Alice Clayton really knows how to deliver a wellwritten wellpaced story.  Oh and this is a great book for dog lovers!  Favorite quote:  Heres the thing about an enormous penis.  They dont just live in romance novels ...  Pardon me?  he finally said his hands frozen on my hips his lips halfway down my neck.  Sorry.  Actually not sorry.  Actually congratulations.  I pointed down.  This is kind of amazing.

322,  STARS!!  Brilliant!!  It took me a while to gather my thoughts on this story.  I dont even know what to say about this book other than it was fanfreakingtastic.  Beth Flynn is a master storyteller.  Let me stop right here and say that if you have not read Nine Minutes you must must must read that book before starting this one.  OUT OF TIME is filled with spoilers as well as a huge cast of characters that will have your head spinning if you have not yet read the first book.  The events that occur in OOT are absolutely mindboggling.  Cathy and I both thought we knew where this story would go but believe me even in our wildest imaginations we never could have guessed the twists and turns that occurred in this book.  We are both huge Grizz fans.  I loved him even more after reading the flashback scenes and learning about this childhood such as it was.  His devotion/obsession with Ginny was more fully explained and the use of flashbacks was perfection.  A word about that: Cathy is a tough reader almost impossible to please and she LOVED this book!  She actually called it perfect!  And that word sums up Beth Flynns storytelling ability.  Every character in Out of Time is essential there are no throwaway scenes and absolutely no unnecessary drama.  Make no mistake this book is violent it is gritty but it is unbelievable gripping intense and sexy.  My heart broke several times over while reading this story.  And while I am a GFFL Grizz Fan for Life!   Beth Flynn did an amazing job with Grunts character.  His love for Ginny is endless.  This is the kind of book that must be savored reread and discussed.  There is that much going on.  And the world of MCs is not in any way sugarcoated yet the story is immensely readable and unforgettable.  At the core of this series is the love Grizz has for Ginny.  It is unending.  OUT OF TIME is without question one of the best books we have read this year.  This series is a mustread.  Dont miss out.  The only truth you ever need to know is that my love for you is real and will never go away.  And everything Ive done no matter how it looks is so you could be protected.  I never wanted to be without you but its not my choice now.,5,False
323, Tiffany Reiszs writing is pure perfection.  Her books are among my alltime favorites and The King was an absolute delight to read from beginning to end.  I have always loved Kingsley Edge so I couldnt wait to read an entire book about him!  And once again the author completely captivated and enthralled me.  He thought of nothing remembered nothing but felt everything.  This book mainly tells the story of Kingsleys relationship with Soren but there are plenty of other characters making an appearance in this book.  Of course I am addicted to Kingsley and Soren so their scenes together are completely mindblowing and absolutely satisfying.  This is a very adult and sophisticated book the prose is gorgeous and the dialogue is pure genius.  Even though I though I know Kingsleys story the author provides plenty of delicious surprises along the way.  I LOVED this book!!!  Its sexy funny incredibly dramatic and gutwrenching and completely amazing.  I did miss Nora she is not really the focus of The King but she plays a pivotal role nonetheless.  The focus here is on Kingsley and his story.  I adored the authors snappy banter smart storyline and very topical themes.  Whats your poison?  the bartender asked and Kinglsey answered Blonds.  The King is a mustread!!  You will lose yourself in this book.  I miss Kingsley already!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
324, . stars!  Maybe Not is the funny sexy and unputdownable story of Warren and Bridgette and their sometimes rocky and always passionate road from enemies to lovers.  This is a novella spinoff of MAYBE SOMEDAY and must must must be read after MAYBE SOMEDAY which by the way is one of my alltime favorites and is not to be missed.  There is a major spoiler in this story that will take away a bit from your enjoyment of Maybe Someday if you are a firsttime reader.  Once again Colleen delivers a fresh perfectlywritten intense and witty storyline that kept me reading well into the night.  Warren cant stand his new roommate Bridgette at first but their constant bickering fighting and pranking quickly turns into something more:  Oh my God.  Im obsessed.  Im like a stalker.  I am a stalker.  Shes so confusing Shes so frustrating.  Shes so damn unpredictable.  Shes nothing Ive ever wanted in a girl.  And absolutely everything I need.  Im kinda obsessed with Colleens characters and Maybe Not is no excerption.  The dialogue and the story are flawless and remind me once again why I will read anything this woman writes.  Oh and theres also plenty of steam in this one to please every romance reader.  Enjoy!,5,False
325, I cant quite put into words the beauty heartbreak emotions and sensuality of this book.  Of course Leah Raeder has a gift with words that was evident from Unteachable and Black Iris.  But Cam Girl took so many twists and turns that my head and my heart were left reeling.  A book about love acceptance sexuality and I think also friendship and loyalty Cam Girl is one of my favorite books of the year.  There is a rawness to Ms.  Raeders writing that is addictive and very real and very challenging.  Vada and Ellis kept me constantly guessing constantly on edge and ultimately left me with a much deeper understanding of the human condition.  Vada is an artist who has become unable to draw like she had in the past.  She is forced to drop out of grad school.  But she never stops thinking like an artist and seeing the world through a artists eyes.  Art is an imperfect impression of the world.  As the self is an imperfect impression of the soul.  This story is about losing love finding love and learning to love yourself.  I highlighted so many parts of this book that I cant possibly pick out my favorite quotes!  Vada and Ellis journey was suspenseful sexy and breathtaking and Im not revealing more of the plot other than to say read the blurb and then dive right into this fabulous sexy and beautifully written book.  Ms.  Raeders prose is lyrical and her words come alive on the page.  My love is savage and rapacious.  It isnt content to the touch.  It wants to be inside crawl into the marrow caress each vein until the cells are all mixed up and there is no you and me anymore no secrets or shadows sliding between our skin.  Be prepared to be challenged.  Cam Girl is not your everyday story.  It is filled with unforgettable characters and a story I wont soon forget.  Another mustread from Leah Raeder.,5,False
326, . Stars!  Tessa and Luke.  They absolutely cant stand each other...but really they are perfect for each other!  All I Want is the second book in the Alabama Summer series and can be read as a standalone although it is recommended that you read Book  first.  I have not read the first book and I still loved this second installment in the series.  The sex is HOT the attraction undeniable and the story fastapced and gripping!  Tessa and Luke are two incredibly stubborn people who just cant seem to stop torturing each other.  Tessa broke up with Luke for what she thought was good reason if a little misguided and while he cant forgive her he also cant seem to stay away from her either.  Im a sucker for a hot Alpha in a uniform and Luke is one protective sexy cop.  He has a very very painful family life one that he hides from Tessa much to her dismay.  Despite her initial resentment of Luke and jealousy over his random hookups she really wants to be there for him emotionally.  Much of this book is spent with these two fighting and then having scorching hot sex.  J. Daniels can really write a superhot sexy and fastpaced read that will keep you very entertained.  This book is as lighthearted as some of her other books but it is very enjoyable and I recommend it for fans of secondchance romance and superhot sexy Southern Alphas who wont take no for an answer!  And not to fear these two have a HEA even after all of their emotional ups and downs.  And I cant wait for the next book in this series Reed!  Bring it on!,4,False
327, I cant say much about this book because I dont want to give the plot away but I was completely and totally immersed once again in the world of the Weavers and the Hawks!!  This book has a little bit of a different tone to it than the previous books because there are lots of questions that are answered.  This series is EPIC!!  And I would LOVE to see it made into a miniseries.  Im in denial that there is only one more book left in this series!  I dont know how Ms.  Winters dreams up these plots but Im glad she has such an incredibly vivid imagination and I cant wait for the next book in the Weaver/Hawk family saga.,5,False
328,  DARK AND SEXY STARS!!  Pepper Winters has created yet another richly woven story in Final Debt along with even more backstory and fantastic insight into the series characters.  It is difficult for me to adequately describe my feelings about this book and the characters first because Ive read early copies of almost every one of them and second because Jethro and Nila are two of my favorite main characters.  It is hard to say the word hero in the same sentence as Jethro because of the dark nature of this series but trust me he truly becomes the man he is meant to be in Final Debt.  And the Epilogue?  Pure gold.  I was completely and utterly satisfied with the way the author concluded this series.  My emotions were all over the place while reading this last book and the Epilogue.  At times I was fearful that the worst would happen and at other times I was hoping against hope that Nila and Jethro would overcome all of the dark forces that conspired against them.  To say this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement.  The historicalromancethemed tone of this series again shines through in this book and I am THRILLED at the announcement of a related book about William Hawk!  The only thing that would make me happier is if these books were made into a movie or television series.  Expect LOTS of surprises in this incredibly satisfying conclusion to the Indebted Series.  My heart is breaking a little at saying goodbye to Jethro and Nila.,5,False
329, Having read and loved Incandescent I couldnt wait to read Affliction the second book in the Knights Rebels MC series.  Affliction was a but of a surprise having a much more emotional story than the first book in the series.  This book can absolutely be read as a standalone although the characters are first introduced in Book One and some of the plot might be a little spoilerish.  Sy is angry gruff and hardedged having suffered a very very painful loss several years before.  He spends the first part of the book acting like a complete jerk towards our heroine Holly and at times I almost felt like the author was making him into a lost cause.  Holly is spirited and outgoing and we first meet her in Book One.  She meets Sy when her best friend becomes involved with the Club President.  Holly too has spiraled into a very dark place and Sy is drawn to her and knows that he can help her overcome her emotional scars.  I grew to love Sy while reading this book and absolutely adored the protective way he treated Holly.  While this story might seem like it is dark and very emotional the sex scenes are off the charts hot and very very steamy.  And there is actually a beautiful love story here and a lovely message about forgiveness acceptance and letting go of the past.  All in all this is a great story for all fans of MC romance.  I cant wait to read more from this author!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False

332,   . Sexy Stars!  Delicious!!!  DARK WILD NIGHT is a very sexy very readable fastpaced story about two friends who want to move out of the dreaded friend zone.  I had forgotten how incredibly HOT and sexy Christina Laurens stories can be!!  OLIVER!  Christina Laurens stories are a bookcrack addiction that I dont intend to give up!  I didnt think I could love a couple any more than the other couples in this series but I was wrong.  Oliver is sexy sweet romantic and totally sensual and loving on top of it all!!  No assholeyness here just a sexysweet feelgood romance.  I absolutely fell in love with Lola shes a total geek and totally adorable.  These two are the only ones of their group of friends who didnt stay married after the shenanigans in Las Vegas.  But they are close friends who dont want to ruin a good thing by becoming involved romantically.  Even though I knew what was ultimately in store for these two it still didnt put a damper on my enjoyment of this lushlywritten yet totally modern story.  Oliver and Lola are two of the most real characters to date in this series.  Lola is consumed with her work and Oliver backs off when she needs space.  There is no unnecessary drama here just two people who care deeply for each other have smokinghot chemistry but who have insecurities just like the rest of us.  I dont think Ive ever loved anyone quite like this.  In this sort of giddy obliterating gamechanging way.  Where I can see myself with her for the rest of my life...  I feel in love with Oliver and cant wait for more yumminess from this awesome writing duo.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
333, What a fresh and surprising story!  Deliciously awkward funny and sexy Beautiful Secret is a fabulous addition to Christina Laurens fantastic series of books.  Niall Stella is irresistible!!  He is stunning sexy and smart but he is definitely inexperienced when it comes to love and his lack of selfconfidence makes this book really different and very very endearing.  Ruby is hilarious and the cast of supporting characters is of course fabulous and make for lots of snappy banter.  You will adore this book if you are a fan of Christina Lauren and even if youve never read any of their books this book definitely can be read as a standalone.  Superhot funny and very fastpaced Beautiful Secret hits all the high notes and is definitely a mustread!  Thanks to the publisher for an ARC.,4,False

335, .   stars!  TIGHT is another unexpected gripping very sexy story from Alessandra Torre.  It is best that you dont read much about this book before going in so that you can read it with a fresh eye.  The plot is nothing that I expected and delivered a thrilling onetwo punch that came out of left field!  On its surface the story is a contemporary erotic romance between Riley and Brett.  They meet while she is attending a bachelorette party and like most books by Ms.  Torre there are other factors at play here that are lurking just below the surface.  The chemistry between the two is undeniable the sexy times are off the charts and the action is heartstopping and fastpaced.  This is not a lighthearted book it takes very dark turns but if you stick with this book you will be rewarded with a very satisfying ending.  Riley is a very strong heroine and Brett is unforgettable.  And talk about the steam factor!  SWOON!  Tight is a fairly quick read mostly because you wont be able to put it down.  It does not contain huge twists but it does deliver an absolutely fantastic story with a very strong heroine and a totally swoonworthy Alpha hero.  Dont miss this one!,5,False

337, . stars!  Pam Godwin is at the top of my list of favorite authors.  Her dark and thrilling stories are among my most treasured books so I was absolutely thrilled to read a copy of Dirty Ties.  I loved the crime/thriller/revenge twists in this story.  As with all of Ms.  Godwins books the characters are engaging the story is twisted and the steam factor is completely off the charts.  Kaci is highly educated hard working and a loyal wife to Collin.  Their unconventional marriage has led to a lonely life for Kaci and she is desperately seeking the intimacy that is missing from with her husband.  Her fascination with the underground racing circuit in Chicago leads her to the mysterious Evader a man who has plenty of secrets himself.  These two become enmeshed in a dangerous game that will certainly leave one the of them broken.  I love how Ms.  Godwin always writes very strong heroines who arent afraid to go after what they want.  Her women are determined smart and driven and Kaci is no different.  She might have met her match with a sexy man she meets one night and these two together were absolute magic!  She was a wild card and that fucking terrified me.  Lightening up this dark and sexy story are some humorous moments which were a welcome relief from the intense storyline.  I especially loved Kaci and Collins interactions and Kacis internal debates especially when it came to the hot new guy she meets:  What about me?  The possessive hand on my thigh clenched.  Are you interested?  Oh let me count the ways.  And each one led to heartbreak.  There were lots of twists and turns in this one!  Loved the story.  Dirty Ties is another great book from Pam Godwin!

338, . stars!  I read The Hurricane in one sitting and was completely surprised by this fantastic debut book!!  This story went way beyond my expectations and I absolutely fell in love with Cormac OConnell.  This book is not a standard fighter romance but instead takes its time developing the characters their relationships and the secondary characters in this story.  I loved it all!  And I especially loved the British flavor to this book.  While this book has PLENTY of steam and sexy times Emily and Cormacs relationship is not just based on sex  they start off slowly as friends because she is literally scared of her own shadow and frightened of a relationship with a man.  Emily McCarthy is sweet quite smart and antisocial.  It takes Cormac to me a gentle giant to slowly bring her out of her shell.  Safe is boring.  Emily is hardworking and paying her own way through University.  She doesnt want to fall for Cormac but he takes things gradually and vows to protect her no matter what.  Eventually she learns to trust him and to let herself actually feel something for another person.  He was the loud to my quiet the confidence to my shyness the rage to my pain.  Separately we were broken and alone.  Together we were blissfully happy and complete and every time that we made love was a celebration.  There is plenty of tension in this fastpaced story and I adored the secondary characters as well.  The Hurricane is a stellar debut novel and I cannot wait to read more from this author!

340, .   hot and wild stars!  How I love the writing duo of K.A.  Merikan.  I will read anything that these two write.  And Tooth OMG I know hes gay but I think he might be my new book boyfriend!!  Hes bearded huge tough and unexpectedly tender with Lucifer.  But dont even ask where he got the nickname of Tooth!  Although this is the second book in a series the books can be read as standalones.  In The Devils Ride Tooth is ordered to protect the Club Presidents son and at first it is a painful unwanted chore.  Luci is a brat and very out of the closet very different than Tooth.  But he is crazy about Tooth even if a little scared of him and even acts out so that Tooth will punish him.  Although I absolutely adored the smexy times between these two and they are SCORCHING HOT I also loved the gritty and very violent look inside MC life.  This is not a sugarcoated story at all.  I loved the underlying story about a crime the MC is trying to solve.  Not for the faint of heart!  I absolutely adored the slowburn of Tooth and Lucis relationship.  It made their love scenes together all the sweeter.  And did I mention that K.A.  Merikan can write some of the most erotic sex scenes out there?  You will need a cold shower after reading The Devils Ride!!  I couldnt put this book down and I literally cant wait for the next book in this series.

341, .   Stars!  I enjoyed this hockey book a lot and recommend it for anyone who likes a good hot sports story with a lot of heart.  Alex is an incredibly gifted hockey player who comes from an abusive background which is now affecting his game and his relationship with his teammates.  As part of a penalty he is required to volunteer at a local drugabuse prevention program alongside the beautiful and selfless Sutton.  She is different from the hockey groupies who throw themselves at him but at first he is a total jerk to her.  No matter.  Sutton sees the wounded person inside and they begin to fall for each other even as he tries to push her away emotionally.  Ive been a prick far longer than Ive been charming.  Youre seeing a new side to me but you know the old is bound to come out.  We all have days when our monsters come out Alex.  Youre not going to scare me off if I see yours.  Sutton is feisty and educated and sees through Alexs B.S.  She too comes from a dysfunctional family but unlike Alex she has a positive outlook and is very close to her family.  Will she be able to bring out the best in Alex and help him overcome his past demons?  This book has more layers than a typical sports romance story and the characters really grew on me.  I loved the hockey scenes and the steam factor between these two is AMAZING.  I have one tiny issue with this story and I have found that it is not just unique to this book.  Why cant a heroine be on birth control because she doesnt want to get pregnant?  Why does it have to be to regulate her periods?  This did not affect my enjoyment of the book I am just surprised to see this recur over and over again in books.  Overall I really like the authors writing style.  Alex is a sweetly sexy story with a heroine who is no pushover.  It is a quick romantic read with a VERY satisfactory conclusion.  I actually found myself tearing up near the end!  I also LOVED the other team members and I know they will have some great stories too.  ARC provided in return for an honest review.,4,False
342, What do you get when you mix Colleen Hoover and Tarryn Fisher together?  A thrilling fastpaced GRIPPING and memorable story called Never Never.  If you have ever read anything written by Colleen Hoover you know you are getting rich characters an unforgettable plot and just all around amazing stories.  And Tarryn Fisher has an imagination that cant be rivaled!  Ever read her The Love Me With Lies series?  Amazing.  And Never Never ranks right up there with these writers best books.  From the first words of this book I was left feeling like someone pulled the rug out from under me.  This overall feeling of disorientation is vital to the story and the authors pulled it off with great success.  I sympathized with the characters felt their confusion and could not stop turning the pages!  This isnt exactly a paranormal story and I cannot wait to see where the story goes.  This review is brief because this book is best read without knowing too much about the plot.  It is highly imaginative inventive and very very different.  Dont miss this one!

343,  Compelling Unputdownable Stars!  Id discovered sex at a really young age completely by happenstance and like music it had touched a nerve with me.  I still craved that feeling that closeness and I sought it out as often as I could.  I wasnt picky about who I slept witholder younger attractive homely mothers girlfriends wives.  Who they were didnt matter to me I only cared that they were interested.  That probably wasnt the best thing to admit but it was the truth.  Sex was a release for me.  It made me feel like a part of something bigger than myself made me feel connected to the world around me.  And I needed to feel that way.  My life was full of empty spaces.  And so begins this unexpectedly sexy and compelling book told from Kellan Kyles POV.  Forget that you think you know Kellan and Kieras story Thoughtful is a fresh and emotional story and is an absolute mustread!  This book is a tribute to the fantastic talent that is S.C.  Stephens.  Kellans voice is very male very original and very very sexy!  My heart once again ached for him as we were given a peak inside his head and inside his heart.  This story gives us insight into Kellan and Kieras undeniable attraction the heartache they both experienced and some amazing sexy times between the two of them.  It is painful but compelling and I could not put this book down.  For a brief second I wondered what she really thought about me.  Did she know anything about me besides my name and that I was in a band?  Did she realize I screamed my heart out in my lyrics?  Did she understand that my life left me feeling vacant inside?  That I was so fucking lonely I almost couldnt stand myself?  Would she want to know any of that?  Or was the fact that I was a rock star enough for her?  Like it was for all the other girls Id slept with.  I absolutely loved the music scenes and they are an integral part of this book.  I literally swooned all over again reading Thoughtful.  When it was time for us to go play a familiar feeling washed over meanxiousness mixed with peace.  As I walked up the steps to the stage worn with use I felt the remnants of who I was melting off me.  Onstage none of my worries touched me.  It was like I was a different person.  Like I was acting and yet I was being more truthful than I ever was off the stage.  I bled my heart out while I was performing not that many people truly noticed they were too busy enjoying the showmanship to dig beneath the surface of the words.  There was safety in the scrutiny anonymity in the spotlight.  I felt invincible up there.  Just me and my guitar.  The loneliness the pain of first love...it is all here and more.  Thoughtful is a mustread and I applaud the author for giving us an amazingly fresh and new look at the irresistible Kellan Kyle.  Thoughtful is mustread!  Enjoy!,5,False
344, .   STARS  This is hardly love.  Then its hardly lust.  Then well just call it us.  ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!  TURBULENCE was perfectly DIRTY funny and smart.  I could not put it down.  There are books that fulfill a certain reading mood and this juicy story was just what I needed.  I totally connected with Gillian and Jake and more importantly FELT their connection too.  The chapter headings in this book are priceless and the story line was incredibly creative.  Just when I thought the author was taking a predictable path the plot veered off into unexpected territory.  Our hero Jake is cold distant and sarcastic but boy can he fuck.  He is a MACHINE.  He has a woman waiting in every city.  When our heroine Gillian meets him they both agree to a strictlysex arrangement.  But of course you know that one of them is going to fall hard and get their heart broken.  But its what happens along the way that makes for a yummy delicious insanely addictive story.  And oh my God the sex in this book is burning hot.  I mean this is totally NSFW readingunderthecovers kind of sex.  Well always be fucking Gillian He smiled biting my lip before tossing me onto the bed.  Thats the best part of us.  This book would have been  stars for me except for some minor details.  It might seem clever to name characters after real authors but to me it cheapens the story.  Many readers will recognize one of the main characters in this book but again that detail lessened the impact of the story to me.  Finally proofreading would have helped to correct certain inconsistencies in the story.  BUT overall I adored this book and completely devoured it!!  I highly recommend TURBULENCE and cant wait for more from this author!  Youre still my anomaly Gillian he said softly.  You always will be.,5,False
345, PURE PERFECTION!  I could read only Kristen Ashley books and be very happy.  RIDE STEADY is another slamdunk winner from the Queen of Alphas with a story that ripped my heart out and characters that I wont soon forget.  Joker might be one Ms.  Ashleys most unforgettable Alphas ever a man who rose from a painful and loveless childhood to become a patchedin Brother of the Chaos MC.  Chaos became his family and the MC recognized the fire burning in Joker that would serve the club well.  He was at the shop window empty pockets face pressed to the glass starin at what he wanted but couldnt have.  Ill wager to survive hes banked that fire.  We gotta help him direct it and make sure if it flares bright it doesnt burn him out.  Carissa Teodoros life becomes entwined with Jokers as the two former high school classmates meet again years later.  Let me just say that this book is so incredibly gripping and heartbreaking and sexy that I am tempted to reread it to experience these feelings all over again!  She was once the golden girl who had it all and he was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  Their story spans years and that is what I love about Ms.  Ashleys writing: there is no Instalove here instead our hero and heroine have a shared history that adds a depth and richness to this book.  Yeah Carrie he answered.  Its you.  Its always been you.  Itll always be you.  Fuckin always.  Joker is a sexy badass Alpha biker that has zero interest in relationships or in real friendships for that matter since he has a hard time opening up to anyone about his feelings or his past.  That is what makes his relationship with Carrie so poignant: this is a man who is so closed off and afraid of emotional bonds that he has been alone and lonely most of his life.  Carrie draws his out just by being herself.  She is going through a messy and painful divorce has a baby is struggling to make ends meet and has a ton of emotional baggage.  She is not perfect but she is open to love and gives her heart unconditionally to Joker.  Rule he stated instantaneously.  His strange word made me blink at the lockers.  Sorry?  Rule.  You cant be like that on the phone.  You can only be like that when I can kiss you.  I lifted a hand and pressed it to the cold steel of my locker leaning into it because my knees suddenly wouldnt support me.  You hear me?  he asked.  Yes Joker.  OH.  EM.  GEE!!  SWOON I cant say enough about Ride Steady.  Plus some of my favorite badass Alphas from Ms.  Ashleys other books make appearances here!  Dead.  There is also a sneak peek at the next Chaos book at the end of Ride Steady and it sounds amazing.  Joker and Carissas story is beautiful thrilling and passionate.  Ride Steady is a mustread!  Favorite quotes:  Butterfly youre cute all the time cuter some times more than others and its fucked up because right now youre bein a pain in the ass and this is one of those times that youre cuter.  But you gotta get this so you can get over it.  My old man doesnt exist for me.  I left him and that life behind and I dont want it back in any way it can come back.  We are who cares about us.

346, Locke is the last book in the Corps Security Series.  Although each book can be read as a standalone the series is fantastic and you really get a sense of the strong camaraderie and history between the characters if you read the series.  It is hard to say goodbye to these beloved characters but Harper Sloan does in in style with Locke.  Locke has a horrible relationship with his family as does Emmy each in a different way.  They both suffer terrible emotional and physical abuse.  Locke has been convinced by his family that he is worthless evil bad etc. so it is no wonder that he believes he has nothing to offer anyone let alone Emmy.  Emmy has always loved Locke and when these two finally get together its the usual hot and fiery CorpsSecurity badass Alpha way!  Locke wont let anyone or anything harm his Emmy and she helps him finally confront his own personal demons.  This is a fastpaced really sexy and hot read.  I love this series and fell in love with all the Corps Security men.  Lockes family felt a little over the top to me almost cartoonish in their behavior but other than that I loved this book and highly recommend it.

347, Skye Warren is my goto author for dark sexy richlywritten erotica.  Annika Martin is a new author to me and now I want to read all of her books too!  As with all of Skyes books the hero Grayson yes he is a hero to me is darkly sexy dangerous forbidden and completely overpowering.  He knows his power and attraction and he uses it against those weaker than him.  Unfortunately it is a survival skill he learned at a very young age.  Abigail meets him in prison when she is picked to teach a writing course to the inmates.  But very quickly she realizes that Grayson is dangerously attractive untrustworthy and dishonest.  Or is he?  This book literally kept be turning the pages until the middle of the night.  There is no right and wrong in this book only two extremely damaged and vulnerable people who quickly become the target of a massive manhunt.  Prisoner takes one thrilling turn after another and Abigail who fought Grayson with all her might slowly realizes that all is not as it seems.  I loved Abigails bravery in the face of absolute and complete danger.  At first it seems as though Grayson would just as soon kill her than f her.  But as with all for Skyes books and I will assume Annikas books as well this intensely sexual man is struggling with his own inner demons.  Grayson makes no apologies for his actions.  But will he and Abby survive all of the forces out to destroy them.  I couldnt put this book down.  The prose is perfect and the story thrilling sexy and even tender and heartbreaking at times.  It is told in alternating pointofviews which gives great insight into Graysons motivations.  I was devastated to see this story end and I can only hope that the authors intend to write more stories including Graysons crew.  I absolutely loved Prisoner.  It is gritty raw sexy very layered and nuanced.  Highly recommended.,5,False

349,  STARS!!  ...the problem with books is that they end.  They seduce you.  They spread their legs to you and pull you inside.  And you go deep and leave your possessions and your ties to the world at the door and you like it inside and you dont want for your possessions or your ties and then the book evaporates.  Every word every line of this book is PERFECT.  I have never been so creeped out or laughed so hard.  Im obsessed with Joe Goldberg!  Joe is obsessed with Beck.  But I mean hack into her email stalk her every move kind of obsessed.  And he is sick.  Very very sick.  But that doesnt stop Caroline Kepnes from making him one of the funniest creepiest saddest meanest and kindest characters of all time.  He just wants Beck to love him.  And that is no easy feat.  Beck is at once smart selfinvolved funny cruel and naive but Joe is very very determined.  You are a woman and I am a man and we belong in the dark together and you smell good pure.  I like that.  This is not a romance but it is without a doubt one of the most memorable books I have ever read.  Just when you think Joe has sunk to a new low he goes even lower.  He is perverted and weird and I am obsessed with him!!  This book is filled with absolutely unforgettable characters.  And the jokes about New York City living are the best.  As is the sarcastic witty and biting commentary on modern life in general.  I highlighted practically the entire book.  I cant recommend YOU highly enough.  It is a weird wild ride.,5,False
350, . Deliciously Thrilling Stars!  He had the manners of a gentlemen all wrapped up in the cutthroat harshness of a criminal.  Just...WOW!!  I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and RUIN  RULE is another dark actionpacked and twisted tale from this incredibly talented writer.  If youre a fan of MC books then you add this one to your mustread list!!  It has it all a strong beautiful and spirited heroine a tortured complicated hero tons of action and lots and lots of complicated plot twists and turns.  PURE IN THOUGHTS AND VENGEANCE.  CORRUPT IN ALL THINGS THAT MATTER and the symbolism of what he stood for.  Biker.  I was on pins and needles from the first page of this book.  I experienced the disorientation of our heroine Sarah/Cleo as she woke to the horrific reality of being held captive by a vicious MC gang.  She feels a glimmer of recognition when she sees Arthur Kill Killian but from where?  When?  I kept turning the pages to find the answers.  Does Kill know her?  Why is he so ruthless?  There are so many to this story!  Sarah/Cleo has lost her memory and her only clues to her past are tiny flashes of memories that come to her fleetingly.  She feels a connection to Kill but why?  Im no one.  And no one wouldve helped me.  In my worldyou survive or you die.  You dont rely on others to make sure you do either one.  Its the very first fucking lesson you learn.  The pain in his voice notched around my heart squeezing.  I loved the small glimpses from Kills POV.  This book is a fantastic bundle of delicious mysteries all wrapped up in a sexy dangerous biker package.  Despite his hardened demeanor Kill slowly allows himself to feel something for our heroine all the while knowing his feelings could be the end of him.  For the first time in my godforsaken life I felt... felt something instead of the cold hatred of vengeance.  It gave me strength all while making me weak.  I wanted more.  Therefore I had to stop.  Before she destroyed mejust like all the rest.  Pepper Winters made me feel sorry for Kill despite his outwardly vicious demeanor.  This was a man who had suffered terribly and been horribly mistreated.  But by whom?  Many answers are revealed but I am definitely craving more.  Id been spoonfed lies all my life.  Id become a master at smelling untruths.  And the woman currently residing in my homethe woman whod healed me  smelled terrifyingly toxic.  A scent that made me want to run with one heartbeat and then fuck her with the next.  She made me face things I was no longer strong enough to face.  She made me look past her scam and crave.  RUIN  RULE is told through a series of flashbacks interwoven with the presentday story.  Pepper Winters is the mistress of a gripping and intense story and this one is no exception.  Just when I though I knew what the outcome would be she proved me wrong.  RUIN  RULE is also a STUNNINGLY beautiful love story and succeeds as a romance on every level.  There is a twist at the end and I cannot wait to get the next chapter in Kill and Cleos story!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
351, Debt is one of the darkest most erotic books I have ever read.  This story is not for the faint of heart so heed the warnings but if you are ready for a stunning thrilling twisted and emotional story then Debt is for you.  A suspenseful and revengefilled tale Debt had me on the edge of my seat from the first page.  I highlighted so much of this book that I could fill this review with amazing passages but read it for yourself and experience this fantastic and sexy story.  I have never read a book by Nina Jones and she absolutely blew me away by this story.  This man is my stalker my terrorizer my lover.  Told in flashbacks and in alternating POVs Debt is a story about Tax Draconi who has come to settle an old debt from Mia Tibbett.  He at first appears to be filled with hate revenge and basically with pure evil.  His actions throughout much of the book are absolutely unforgivable.  But the author is an absolute genius at making me actually love Tax and empathize with him.  The scenes with Mia are beyond explicit.  Tax brings new meaning to the phrase dirty talker.  Its what I do when it comes to women.  I cant give them affection or love or intimacy.  That all died in me long ago.  So I give what I can: Relief.  Pleasure.  Abandon.  The focus of his plan is Mia who remains mostly clueless about why Tax hates her so much but still finds herself powerless under his erotic spell.  He owns her body and soul.  She realizes that he has ruined her for other men and despite his evil ways she still feels compelled to try to break through his wicked exterior.  Is it possible Tax could be everything I need in a man?  He has the fire that burns me and awakens me.  That was the thing I had been looking for and it is so uniquely hard to find.  The trauma that Tax and his twin sister Jude suffered at a young age is hinted at throughout the story and when finally revealed sheds light on his behavior and Judes thirst for revenge against Mia as well.  This book might shock you but the story flows and the characters are unforgettable.  I found a few minor inconsistencies with the story which in no way took away from my enjoyment of this dark sexy.  erotic dark and fantastic story.  I was distraught that Debt ended and I am waiting notsopatiently for more from Ms.  Nina G. Jones!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
352, What a passionate and intense love story!!  Broken Juliet is THE perfect ending to Cassie and Ethans epic journey.  I loved this book because it mixes both love and heartbreak seamlessly.  I was so wrapped up in Cassie and Ethans grand love story that I was thrown completely offbalance just like Cassie!  when things would go wrong.  And I loved every single minute of it!!  The author once again switched between both past and present here and while the backandforth can be jarring in some books it worked perfectly here.  Broken Juliet picks up literally right where Bad Romeo ended.  Ethan has broken Cassies heart more than once and he is begging her for another chance.  Cassie has finally moved on with her life and cannot believe that Ethan has finally changed and is open to really love her.  One of the many many things that I loved about this book is that it mixes in plenty of humor with the heartbreak and passion.  Cassie is tentatively letting Ethan back into her life but she is trying her best to move slowly so her heart doesnt get trampled once again.  Her inner monologue can be hilarious:  I cant drive.  Is it cool for me to sleep on the couch?  No.  Get out before I mount you.  Broken Juliet is a heartpounding passionate love story above all else.  Leisas writing is flawless and the chemistry between her two main characters absolutely off the charts.  I was so connected with Ethan and Cassie that I was on the edge of my seat reading this book.  And when Ethan gives Cassie his journals to read?  Perfection.  Cassie finally understands what was going on inside Ethans head when he left her in drama school years before.  These two share a passion and a love that is undeniable and absolutely breathtaking:  This man represents so many things to me.  He was my first true friend.  My first love.  First lover.  The master of more pleasure than I knew existed and the architect of more heartache than I thought I could endure.  I also really loved the behindthescenes look into the world of theatre.  I appreciated the authors insights into the world of stage actors and the acting process.  Some of my favorite scenes take place when Ethan and Cassie are in drama school these are soulbaring painful and beautiful passages to read.  I cant recommend this series highly enough and I am totally addicted to Ethan Holt!!  Both books are out now so get reading!  . passionate and heartpounding stars!  Favorite quotes:  The thing about developing an addiction is that it happens so quietly you dont know how much trouble youre in until its too late.  It tiptoes through the rooms of your mind and body gently inserting hooks and strings into every cell until you dont know where you end and it begins.  And untangling that web is nearly impossible.  This is more than lust.  Its even more than love.  Its imperative.  Mindless bloodyminded need.  I cant kiss him deep enough or hold him close enough.

353,  perfect stars!!  Well.  Where do I begin?  Bad Romeo is one of my favorite books of the year.  It is the perfect blend of comingofage intense longing heartache friendship and first love.  The story is told in a mix of presentday and flashbacks which can be confusing but work perfectly here.  Ethan Holt is the classic badboy who smashed Cassie Taylors heart when they were drama students.  Flashforward to present day when they are both cast as the leads in a Broadway play.  Told from Cassies point of view the book follows their completely tortured angstfilled relationship.  But dont be scared away: this book is raunchy laughoutloud funny and will keep you turning the pages to see what will happen next.  Can Cassie work with Ethan again after what he did to her in the past?  She cant seem to stay away from him and Leisa Rayven gives a wonderful slowbuild story that kept me reading until the wee hours of the night.  I was fascinated by the behindthescenes look at the theatre world and the sometimespainful description of the acting process.  And even though this is a New Adult novel it is incredibly sexy and steamy and filled with just the right blend of longing and sexual release.  And Cassie what a fantastic heroine!  Shes smart toughontheoutside but very vulnerable and funny as hell.  I fell in love with Ethan Holt and even though he was portrayed as a jerk felt sympathetic towards him because of his tortured past.  I cant say enough about this book!  After I finished this book I was fascinated to read that it originally began as fan fiction.  How did I not know this?  I am now officially addicted to this series and this author.  I highlighted practically the entire book.  The ending was perfection and I am literally counting the days until the next book Broken Juliet!

354, . stars!  Looking for a different kind of story but one with scorching hot sex scenes and a strong heroine?  Read Uncivilized now!  I was completely unprepared to fall in love with Zach but I did and I miss him already.  There are some books that merely recite one sex scene after another with no emotional connection between the characters and writing that fails to connect the reader with the characters.  Well not Uncivilized.  Ms.  Bennett has written a sensitive interesting very different story with absolutely memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time.  Zach at first comes across as a somewhat cold savage man who will never become acclimated to the modern world.  But is that such a bad thing?  As the story progresses Moira becomes more willing to bend towards Zachs way of life and his belief system.  And this man is HOT HOT HOT.  The books sex scenes are absolutely among the most gorgeous lush and loving scenes I have ever read.  This book could have been a cliche but its most definitely not.  I loved the world created by Ms.  Bennett and I highly recommend Uncivilized.  Enjoy!  And have a freezer nearby!  ARC provided by the author in return for a honest review.,4,False
355,  / stars!  Dark.  Dark.  Dark.  Those were my first thoughts upon finishing Raze.  I love a good dark and gritty romance and Raze fits the bill.  This book is filled with intense drama and brutal scenes of torture so be warned.  I have a very strong threshold for dark reads but there was an extra element that didnt quite sit well with me.  That being said this book has an incredibly creative storyline and some hot steamy passionate and overthetop sex scenes that are alone worth reading the book for.  This story is told in flashbacks.  Raze was brutally ripped from his home as a teenager and subjected to all kinds of physical and mental abuse at the hands of an underground fighting ring.  He loses his memories of his family and his childhood and literally turns into a fighting machine bent on revenge against the monster who put him away.  These scenes in the underground are difficult tough and gritty.  Raze has the vaguest memories of a girl who is Kisa the daughter of a New York Russsian mobster.  She too is condemned to a live of confinement as the fiancee of Alik a sadisitic brutal and controlling fighter.  The stage is set for her past and her present to collide.  Will she able to save Raze from almostcertain death?  Will Raze ever remember Kisa the only girl he ever loved?  Ive seen too many bad things with these eyes.  This I will feel in my heart.  There are scenes of incredible beauty in this book along with scenes so brutal they are difficult to get through.  But all in all this story kept me turning the pages to see where these characters journeys would take them.  I was cheering for Kisa to stand up to Alik and rooting for Raze to be able to find the peace he so desperately needed.  If you like gritty fighter stories then Raze is the book for you!,4,False
356, Whatever you think you know about this book youre wrong!!  Filled with THE most amazing plot twists and gorgeous moments November  literally took my breath away This book is on my favorites lists not just of  but of all time.  It is absolutely unforgettable!  I read this book in one sitting and was absolutely devastated when it ended!!  The writing is so perfect the story is so creative and the characters are so vivid that I felt like a piece of me was missing was I finished this book.  I felt like I knew Ben and Fallon personally thats how expressive Colleen Hoovers writing is.  Fallon is damaged goods growing up in Hollywood and having survived both emotional and physical trauma when she and Ben meet.  One of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars she says.  A lot of them even worse than mine.  The only difference is that mine are visible and most peoples arent.  Fallon and Ben are only teenagers when they first meet literally on the eve of her big move to New York City.  Could what Fallon feels for Ben be real and lasting?  Only time will tell as they make a pact to meet only once a year until she turns .  No contact no social media stalking nothing until their annual dates.  Fallon believes that this is the only way for her to be mature enough and selfreliant enough to be in a relationship with Ben.  She is determined not to lose herself in a man.  But oh so much can happen in the time in between and as the story unfolds from the past to the present I began to realize what this book was really about.  My heart broke for both Fallon and for Ben and I was completely taken aback by the path this story took.  There are SO many memorable moments in this book and they all took my breath away.  Imagine think you have met your soul mate only to see them once a year for the next few years!  I wanted to scream at Fallon and Ben to grab onto their love and never let it go.  Please say yes.  Please tell me you arent finished falling in love with me yet.  Dont miss November !!  It is yet another flawless book from Colleen Hoover.

357, . stars!!  Holy hotness!  The minute I saw Aleks Voinovs name in the acknowledgements I knew I would LOVE this book and I was right!  His epic work Special Forces is one of my favorite books.  Please heed the author warnings about Guns N Boys this is a dirrrrrrrty homoerotic violent crime thriller.  But wow what a ride!  This book grabbed me from the first page an did not let go.  Seth is the son of a crime lord and is rescued and secreted home by the irresistibly sexy dangerous and dominant Domenico.  The two were childhood friends but hadnt seen or spoken to each other in years.  Domenico was the human equivalent of his motorbike.  Fast and dangerous yet impossible to resist taking a ride on even at the risk of getting hurt.  This book is a fastpaced supersexy graphic and very intense story of two men in a forbidden relationship.  Seth and Dom could not be more different but yet find themselves drawn to each other.  They must hide their relationship and the underlying tension between these two had me on the edge of my seat.  There is a fantastic surprise for fans of the Dark Souls series!!  Even if you havent read the series you will love the character of Sylvio.  Guns N Boys is a superhot incredibly wellwritten steamy thriller.  If you want to move outside your comfort zone and you love M/M books then I highly recommend Guns n Boys.  There will be more books in this series and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment!  For an EXCERPT and GIVEAWAY go here  The Book Bellas,4,False

359, . Stars!  WHOA!!  Ricochet was unputdownable!!  Very very dark violent and sexy.  Loved the fastpaced story.  Great book for dark romance fans.  Told in dual POVs Ricochet pulled me in from the first page and was one of those books that I could not put down.  The storyline is very fresh very original and very very violent and dark.  Which I totally loved.  Nick is hellbent on the revenge of his familys violent death and Aubree is a pawn in his scheme.  But she is trapped in a hellish world of her own in a marriage to a sadistic powerful man from whom she is all to relieved to escape.  Even before Nick abducts her Aubree is fascinated with a mysterious masked man who warns Detroits ruling elite that the citys criminal element is coming down:  Id become obsessed with him just the same.  Behind that mask was a mastermind of the most notorious computer hacks the city had ever known.  His bold threats his willingness to take on my psychopathic husband had turned him into my own personal fantasy.  Is Nick the same myserious dark avenger?  Ricochet is not your average darkromance kidnap story.  Nick is cruel to Aubree but she slowly becomes obsessed with him and he with her.  Even though she started out as just a faceless pawn in his game.  Id fallen in lust with a complete stranger strictly on the basis that he happened to scare the shit out of my husband.  Aubree sees the hurt and pain behind Nicks rage and he slowly realizes that Aubree has suffered as well:  I saw darkness in her beauty and she saw beauty in my darkness.  Yin and yang.  Black and white.  Beauty and scars fury and forgiveness.  She shouldve been my nemesis but in her I found something I didnt know I was looking for.  The law of the streets rule in this book and the action is gritty and unrelenting.  And there is a HUGE twist at the end that I did not see coming.  Ricochet is a great fastpaced emotional gritty and VERY sexy read that I highly recommend.,5,False
360, . stars!!  Cathy and I read this book together which has become a rarity lately!  We both loved this book and found it to be a beautifully written heartfelt story filled with amazing and memorable characters.  And Gus hello!!  What an amazing guy!!  Perfect.  Hes loyal sexy honest hardworking and always there for Kate.  This book tackles some very sensitive subjects so this will be a completely spoilerfree review.  Kate is very funny tough on the outside and gives a lesson in whats important in life to just about everyone she meets.  Cathy is not a huge fan of mature young adult novels and even she loved this one!  Katie didnt just look on the bright side she lived there.  And lets not forget Keller.  We loved Kate with Keller!  Once their slowbuild relationship picked up steam they were irresistible together.  The alternating POVs told in the form of diary entries worked great in this book and really gave great insight into each of the characters state of mind.  Keller grew emotionally and matured over the course of the story which was a beautiful thing to see.  Just when you think you know someone they change.  Or you change.  Or maybe you both change.  And that changes everything.  I loved the book and would have really adored more steamy scenes between Keller and Kate.  Cathy would have liked a little deeper exploration into the music scene.  But we both loved Bright Side and think that Ms.  Holden is an amazingly talented writer.  There are many secrets in this book and you will really enjoy it much more if you dont know what they are.  This book will make you laugh cry and and get lost in the story.  Dont miss this one.  And we are doing a happy dance because it looks like Gus will be getting his own story next year!  SQUEEE!  DO EPIC,4,False
361, Dark.  Sexxxxxy.  Incredibly hypnotic.  Jethro is complex dangerous and absolutely irresistible!  Pepper Winters has woven a tale of deception lust danger and thrills and the story keeps getting better and better.  If you like getting lost in a book I cant think of a better series than this one.  These characters have totally gotten under my skin and I wont soon forget them.  An absolute mustread!,5,False
362, . Stars!  Sexy and totally addictive.  Sustained is written in the unique Emma Chase style that I love!  Ms.  Chase returns to her roots in this supersexy and funny story with lots of heart.  Ms.  Chase really nails the male POV in SUSTAINED and she had me literally laughing out loud at Jakes inner monologue.  Hes a player never letting his onenight stands stay past their first cup of morning coffee and acting quite happy about the way his life is arranged.  If youre my date stick to what will turn you on.  Im not a therapist or Prince Charming  and I dont pretend to be.  Until Chelsea and her brood of six come crashing into his wellstructured life Jake never dreamed hed be remotely interested in a relationship let alone a readymade family of six.  Now I am not usually a fan of kids in my romance books.  I have two big ones and lets just say I prefer a little escapism in my reading.  But Ms.  Chase makes the kids here such an integral part of the story that they were a delight to experience.  Theres no ridiculous babble or babytalk but there are some tough scenes about raising teens bullying and even just trying to find a moment alone with your significant other in the middle of chaos.  But SUSTAINED is at its best when Jake does the talking or thinking!.  Before he meets Chelsea really all he wants is a warm body and some meaningless sex.  A brief dry spell at the beginning of the story led to some of my favorite quotes:  ...You and Hanna are going to be monogamous for a while.  My eyes squint cause I have no idea what hes saying.  Hanna who?  He waves his palm.  Hanna Hand.  Emma Chase writes some of best male POVs I have ever read.  I absolutely loved how Jake evolved in this book from a callous playboy to a guy who realizes whats important in life.  This book is expertly written with a beautiful story tons of steam and witty fastpaced dialogue.  Highly recommended!  Favorite quote:  She frowns back.  And you sound like you dont respect philosophy very much.  All philosophical questions can be answered with one concise statement.  Chelsea refills her glass.  Which is?  Who gives a fuck?  She laughs and its an amazing sound.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
363, We shy away from the things that hurt us  that have hurt us in the past.  Thats what scars are for.  They protect the wounds.  Cover them with thick numb tissue so well never have to fell that same pain again.  The bottom of my stump is one big hard callus  I absolutely adore Emma Chase!  She is back with another supersexy witty and warmhearted story that made me laugh at loud and tear up a bit.  Brent and Kennedys story is sexy funny and completely endearing.  Brent won me over and once again Ms.  Chase shows her skills at writing the male POV.  Brent Mason is a top lawyer and is totally surprised to see Kennedy Randolph again after many years.  She was a sweet and nerdy girl who has now blossomed into a beautiful swan who is also gorgeous smart and his adversary in the courtroom.  Irresistible Brent sleeps around a LOT but never forgot his first love.  Kennedy and Brent now face off in court in a highprofile case which added lots of opportunities for these two to really let the sparks fly.  But its the supporting cast of characters as well as the witty banter between these two that are central to this story.  An interesting twist to the story is that Brent lost his leg in a childhood accident.  He doesnt let this slow him down in ANY area of his life.  This was a refreshing change of pace in an otherwise funny and sexy contemporary romance story.  Kennedy is scared of getting involved with Brent after all these years and the flashbacks to her teenage years when she was bullied at school are very poignant and form a stark contrast to the smart successful attorney she is now.  But Brent will stop at nothing to show Kennedy that she is the love of his life and he is one determined guy!  ...I collapse on top of her my bones turned to Jello.  When the aftershocks eventually ebb she laughs.  That tinkling magical laugh that sings of contentment and tugs up my own lips in a responding smile.  Now that  that is how you start a fcking trial.  Emma Chases fans will eat this one up!  Ms.  Chase keeps up her winning streak with Appealed a great entry in the Legal Briefs series.  Commitment isnt always a burden Brent.  It can also be the source of unimaginable joy and satisfaction.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
364,   . Stars  Emma Chase is one of my favorite authors but this story just did not click with me.  I am in the minority on this one so you should defintely give this one a try!  Lots of readers LOVE Stanton.  A few inconsistencies in the timeline interfered with my enjoyment of the book and I found some of characters to be Southern stereotypes.  I also didnt really feel the emotional connection between Stanton and Sofia.  I absolutely adore this talented author and will always read her books!  Ms.  Chase has a very funny way with her male characters which I love.  Definitely looking forward to the next books in this series.  ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.,3,False
365,  stars!  Magnificent and heartstopping.  This was my first reaction upon finishing Finding Eden the continuation of Calder and Edens story from Becoming Calder.  Mia Sheridan has become one of my goto favorite authors for creative story lines heartstopping emotion and beautiful glorious sexy and REAL love scenes.  This will be a short review because both books should be read together and contain so many twists and turns they are best read without knowing too much detail.  Just know that the author answers all questions left open at the end of Becoming Calder and delivers an incredibly satisfying conclusion for these two amazing characters.  Calder and Eden take an incredible journey and Ms.  Sheridan lets you experience every heartstopping second of it.  Both books taken together are about staying strong staying true to yourself even when everyone around you tells you something different and overcoming incredible obstacles to find your one true love.  This isnt all hearts and flowers there are some really steamy sex scenes along with some very brutal scenes of psychological and physical abuse.  But the author really knows how to bring an epic love story to a wonderful conclusion and Finding Eden does all of that and more.  And well spend as much time as we need just escaping from the world.  Thats our plan because I swear to you my beautiful sweet love everyone deserves a love story that doesnt hurt.  In the end Finding Eden is a story about forgiveness and learning to love yourself no matter what has happened to you in the past.  Run dont walk to pick up a copy of both Becoming Calder and Finding Eden.  Your life will be all the better for having read these books.  Favorite Quote well one of many!  We have to figure out how to forgive not for the people who wronged us but for us.  We cant keep bitterness attached to our hearts because eventually it might become part of usso deeply ingrained we cant work it back out.  I think we have to focus on the beauty weve been given in this life and make that the thing that defines us.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
366, Many readers loved this book but it just wasnt for me.  I am a fan of dark romance dark erotica romantic thrillers the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didnt connect with the main characters.  I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story.  I will read the authors other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.,3,False
367, I loved this book!!  Pure enjoyment!!  Love the humor sexiness and behindthescenes look into the pop music business.  Brooklyn and Jason are forced to write and record a song together but theres one tiny roadblock in their way  he cant stand her and she feels the same way about him!  Jason is a broody folksy musician whereas Brooklyn is a pop princess.  But she actually writes all of her own songs and is really a very warm smart funny sarcastic woman who is lonely and wants to really experience love not just write about it.  Jason only sees the stereotype and is very judgmental toward her at first.  The Duet is very funny witty sexy and just plain unputdownable.  The author makes tons of pop culture references and give the reader lots of sneak peeks inside the business of producing popular music.  The banter between Jason and Brooklyn is absolutely priceless and the story never sinks into sentimentality but instead stays fresh modern and very very witty.  Jason and Brooklyn begin a nostringsattached sexual relationship which of course turns into much more for Brooklyn.  I absolutely loved the sexy times between these two and I loved watching Jasons douchey assholeian no not a word!  facade slowly change.  But he is hiding a whopper of a secret and I was sitting on the edge of my seat to see how this would play out.  The Duet is for sure a romantic comedy but it is much more.  It is about accepting who you are being true to yourself always being honest and the importance of keeping your heart open to love.  I love R.S.  Grey and am totally excited to see that Brooklyns sister Cammie a brilliant architecture student will be getting her own story with Grayson one of Brooklyns best friends!  Bring it on!,4,False
368, Great conclusion to Andrew and Aubreys story in this surprisingly wellwritten installment.  The emotions in the third installment of RD were deeper and the story was more detailed than the first two books in this series.  I loved the characters.  If you can suspend disbelief about working in a law firm then you will love this series.  Much of the legal part of the story was accurate enough which was very refreshing.  This series is a great fairly fast read filled with characters you love and characters you love to hate.  Looking forward to much more from Whitney G.!,4,False
369, I love books that give an alternate POV so Killer Queen was just the right story for me.  You can absolutely read this as a standalone  but L.H.  Cosway is such a talented writer that you should give Painted Faces a try too.  Nicholas is such a memorable and haunting character that I will always remember him.  Beautiful sexy sensitive angry and loving  he is all these things and more.  I like to think of myself as a wonderful and unique snowflake.  Killer Queen is basically Nicholas POV along with some additional scenes.  You really gain a lot of insight into Nicholas character in this book and the Epilogue is absolutely fantastic.  This is a very very unique story  definitely not your standard contemporary romance  and it will change the way you look at gender and sexuality and men and women.  I also loved the added touch of song lyrics at the beginning of each chapter to really match the tone of the story.  I love L.H.  Cosways writing and have every one of her books on my Kindle.  Cant wait to read more by this incredibly gifted author.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False

Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero which I loved the plot of this book fell flat for me and the socalled scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all.  Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself.

371,  stars!!  I squeezed him tight because I already had what I wanted.  Him.  This.  Us.  Unfortunately fantasies are for children and I was a grown woman.  I shouldve known it wouldnt last.  We are HUGE fans of Joanna Wyldes Reapers Motorcycle Club series and Reapers Stand might be our favorite book in the series so far!  And thats saying a lot because each of these books are fantastic.  But Picnics story is grittier edgier meaner...and hello we love that he is a bit older and has certainly lived a rough life.  He has sex with loads of women since the death of his beloved wife wont be tied down but then meets London who is a strong independent woman.  She has lots of burdens to bear and tries to make a go of things with out Picnics help but when these two get together...WOW.  Hes badass tough sexy but funny and this story is one you just cant put down.  Just let me be strong for you for a minute okay?  He said softly.  Youve held on for a long time sweetheart.  Nobody can say you havent been strong.  But its been a hell of a night so why dont you let me hold you and help you right now okay?  We found this book to be incredibly hot and sexy and much darker than most of the other books in this series.  We absolutely loved these two together and Reapers Stand is one of our favorite MC stories.  It is violent but it is also real and the funny moments add some muchneeded levity to the tense storyline.  And the tease at the end...oh my lord!!  The author gives us a peek at the next book in a new series and we cannot WAIT!  ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review,5,False

373, Stepbrother Dearest is to put it simply one of my favorite books this year.  I am trying to avoid using the word epic here as it has been overused a bit but this story took me on an incredible journey that left me nothing short of anxious elated enchanted and drained.  Penelope Ward is hands down one of my favorite authors and this book is an absolute must read.  The story follows Greta and Elec who are stepsiblings.  But like all of Ms.  Wards books there are many layers and nuances to this book and nothing is quite as it seems.  I wont give you exactly the same thing...but I can give you more.  Okay?  I can give you better.  It may be one night but I will make every second count.  Although Elec is her stepbrother I really didnt feel that Gretas love for him was forbidden.  You will have to read the book and judge for yourself on that one.  What I did feel was the incredible sexual tension emotion surprise and yes even humor in Ms.  Wards writing.  Nowadays every single guy seemed to pale in comparison to Elec on the physical attraction meter.  I wanted to crush that meter with a sledgehammer.  Greta is smart quirky funny and compassionate.  Elec is angry cocky sexy and irresistible.  Slowly but surely Greta begins to see behind his angry facade and they eventually form a deep bond.  ... I thought about how ironic it was that this guy whod done nothing but try to chase me away and intimidate me was the one person in the world I felt like I wanted to protect.  But this is only in the first part of the book!  In true Penelope Ward style STEPBROTHER DEAREST is a richly woven tale that spans many years.  The characters grow move on and the story almost loops back on itself.  No spoilers here just read this sexy funny emotional and fascinating story for yourself.  And be prepared to have your heart stolen by Elec.  ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
374, . scorching hot stars!  This was my first book by Nalini Singh and it is a passionate emotional sexy and fulfilling story.  I loved this book!  The writing is incredibly sexy beginning right from almost the first page when sexyashell rock god Fox meets the shy librarian Molly at a party.  It might sound cliched but the story is so well written and the characters so welldeveloped that I was drawn in immediately.  Molly has her reasons for staying out of the spotlight so a good part of the book is spent with her anquishing over stepping into the public arena with a worldfamous musician.  But she is powerless to resist Fox a man who knows what he wants and goes after it.  This book is fastpaced and takes the reader around the globe to New Zealand Australia and California.  And the supporting characters are fantastic from Mollys best friend Charlotte to all of the other band members.  Cant wait to read more about all these characters.  This was a wonderful story and the sex is incredibly HOT!!  The book also created the ohsoimportant emotional connection between the main characters.  I also absolutely fell in love with Fox!  This story is a mustread and is a great begninning to a new series.  Highly recommended to all fans of contemporary romance.,5,False
375, WHOA!!  What a ride!  Fantastic story.  To say it is unexpected is an understatement.  Stayed up all night to finish.  READ THIS BOOK!  These were my first thoughts upon finishing this book an ARC of which was graciously provided by the author.  Why was I on her ARC list?  No clue.  But I thank her from the bottom of my heart.  This is an original story with wellwritten fullydeveloped characters and clever twists and turns which forged a connection between the book and myself.  Am I gushing?  Yes.  Because there are SO many books today that have cookiecutter plots with cliche characters I find it incredibly refreshing to come across a story like Black Lies.  There is no plot or character discussion here.  Read the synopsis.  Thats all you need.  Was this a  perfect story?  No.  But it is absolutely one of the best books I have read this year and I applaud Ms.  Torre for her story.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
376,  thrilling stars!!  Gritty.  Raw.  Suspenseful.  SEXY.  Come take a wild ride through the authors City of Angels and enjoy every second of the hot and thrilling rollercoaster ride.  Antonio and Theresa got under my skin and I cant wait for even more of their story.  Ruin begins shortly after Spin ended.  Theresa has become incredibly determined and strong and will do anything ANYTHING to protect and stay with Antonio.  But he is lethal dangerous and also determined to keep Theresa out of harms way.  Not an easy feat when the mafia is out ot get you and no one is to be trusted.  Theresa is still close to her family and Antonio Spin is acutely aware of that.  But he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe even when the things quite literally start to spin out of control.  He tries to keep her isolated but she will have none of that and his carefullycrafted plans begin to quickly unravel and escalate to an incredibly satisfying conclusion.  This is an actionpacked superhot and sexy story.  The writing is gorgeous and spare.  There are no flowery words no gushing declarations in the world of Antonio Spinelli.  But surprisingly there is humor which provides a welcome relief from the nearconstant state of tension and almost primal sexual urges.  Spin loves Theresa in his own way and they are both completely obsessed with each other and cannot stay apart.  Youre from a different world  but you smell like home to me.  I havent been to Napoli in ten years but whenever youre near me I smell olive flowers.  My heart gets sick with thirst and the water is poison.  I cant stop thinking about Spin and Theresa.  C.D.  Reiss has become one of my favorite writers and I absolutely cannot wait for the next installment in this series.  ARC reviewed from NetGalley.,5,False
377, LOVED IT!!!  Refreshingly funny sweet and sexy!  The Stage Dive series is one of my favorite series and Lead is an absolute delight.  Sexy refreshingly funny and smart Lead not only features the achingly beautiful Jimmy it also introduces us to the fabulous Lena who in my opinion could be every womans new best friend.  Honest funny and real Kylie Scott has written a completely relatable heroine who at times broke my heart and other times had me laughing at loud.  Lena knew that Jimmy would be her Achilles heel almost from the getgo when she is hired to be his assistant and sobriety companion.  Whatever else he might be Jimmy Ferris was special and complicated beautiful and beastly all rolled into one.  A naturalborn performer.  Lena struggles to fit in to the rest of the band dynamics and all the sexy couples of the Stage Dive family.  She is tenacious hilarious and completely turned on and attracted to Jimmy but the real Jimmy not the rockstar persona.  My heroin was sixfootone and gorgeous as sin.  Lena has had her share of heartache and is afraid that Jimmy will steal her heart away while she is working as his assistant and stomp on it in the process.  I absolutely loved how strong Lena was and how she really stayed true to herself and did not try to hide her true feelings for Jimmy.  Will these two get their happy ending that they so desperately deserve?  Love was truly one of lifes mysteries.  That it could f you five ways to Sunday and still remain so utterly perplexing and unknown was kind of impressive.  I guess.  Lead is a fabulous summer read and Kylie Scott is one of my favorite writers.  Enjoy Lead you will fall in love with Jimmy!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
378, I LOVED this funny sexy romance from Amber L. Johnson!  The story is fresh and creative and I absolutely fell in love with Andrew.  What starts off as cute storyline turns into a lovely sweet and very very funny story about overworked Gwen who is struggling to manage raising two young children on her own and Andrew a wealthy seemingly carefree guy who must get a job and really wants to become responsible and selfsufficient and please his cold and distant father.  Eight Days a Week is a fantastic lighter read with an unexpected storyline and interesting characters.  My heart ached for Andrew he has spent his life trying to please his parents and live up to his perfect older sister.  He sees his chance at redemption when he becomes manny for Gwens young family and actually finds something he is very good at.  The children love him and of course he is madly attracted to Gwen.  But they both decide not to pursue their insane chemistry for the sake of the children because what would happen if they broke up?  Will these two be able to love each other and keep their new family together?  I adore Amber Johnsons writing style and was laughing out loud as well as totally swooning many times during this book.  The sexy times are HOT and Andrew really has it all: looks brains and talent.  What woman wouldnt fall for him?  I loved this book and highly recommend it for all fans of sexy funny contemporary romance.,4,False
379, First I was very pleasantly suprised at the steam factor in this book!  And Thomas Maddox is a memorable character thats for sure.  I really liked the romantic suspense aspect of this story and I really admire the author for writing a strong female character.  Oh look its okay to be a workaholic and be a professional!  I am on board with female characters who are not just windowdressing or who do nothing but sorrt of flit around the story.  But I digress.  Liis and Thomas do connect early on but it really works in this book.  Jamie can really write a steamy hot sex scene and I cant wait to read more of this from her!Liis is smart but she is pretty insecure in her personal life.  Id gone from feeling sexy and desired to an embarassingly eager cheap score.  Liis and Thomas must later work together as FBI agents and this aspect of the story was very fastpaced and interesting.  Liis like Thomas is devoted to her work which has not left much time for a personal life.  Ah.  Youre married to the job.  Betty Bureau.  Thomas is a total hardass and has a notorious reputation for being impossible to work for.  Will he soften for Liis?  I loved seeing the other Maddox brothers make an appearance here but make no mistake this was Thomas story through and through.  This book is fastpaced sexy very romantic and a mustread for Jamie McGuire fans.  Favorite quote:  You can love someone without wanting to be with them.

380, . poundinghot stars!!  Seriously thrilling and addictive.  This is the first book I have read by this writing duo and it certainly wont be the last!  This is a gritty thrilling and addictive story.  Please note the series name  SEX and MAYHEM and theres plenty of both!  This is a M/M Motorcycle Club book with a twist: Stitch is a closeted gay biker.  His MC is seriously homophobic and he is not out to his exwife or to his family.  This guy is sex on a stick and and when he meets the sexy and alluring Zak all bets are off.  Zak is a tattoo artist and is completely out.  They have explosive chemistry and these sex scenes are absolutely among the top  hottest scenes I have ever read.  What begins as a sexonly relationship gradually builds into something more.  Stitch grows as a character and little by little comes face to face with his own sexuality.  I had a bad night.  All I wanted was to come home to you.  Stitch and Zak have an intensely passionate relationship but Stitch still will not admit that he is gay.  He imposes secrets and restrictions on Zak and Zak quite naturally rebels and much sex and mayhem ensues.  I found this book to be incredibly gripping and the writing style fastpaced gritty and intensely sexual.  Make no mistake this book is incredibly violent and graphic.  It is also filled with what I found to be highly erotic m/m sex and irresistible characters.  I absolutely loved this very dark and emotional story and cant wait to read more from these authors!

381, Suspenseful doesnt even begin to describe this book.  DO NOT DISTURB is a thrilling dark sexy and fastpaced story with a twist!  If you are looking for a dark smart and erotic story then DO NOT DISTURB is the book for you.  This book is the sequel to THE GIRL IN E a fantastic and surprising story which I recommend that you read immediately!!  The author continues the story of Deanna in DO NOT DISTURB and her story is intertwined with another character who might just might be as dark and disturbed as she is.  But where Deanna tries her best to keep her dark nature hidden away and under control barely this new character does not.  He is plain evil.  The author has done a masterful job at building suspense and anticipation in this book and the plot twists are fantastic.  This is a smart and twisted book and definitely NOT for the faint of heart.  Deanna is faced with danger here in the form of an unhappy client.  Will he outsmart the brilliant Deanna and pierce the layers of protection she has built of around her?  Will Deanna finally find some semblance of normalcy with the sexy and understanding Jeremy?  Once again the author writes a brilliant story that answers all these questions without talking down to the reader and without coming to any false conclusions.  The tensions are high and the sexy times are brilliantly erotic.  I havent stopped thinking about these characters!  I amy dying well not literally for another book in this series!!

382, Wow!  Break the Sky is a brilliant rich and SCORCHING hot storm of a story that will make new fans of Nina Lane.  Kelsey and Archer were seen in the earlier Spiral of Bliss books but you do NOT have to read those books first although they are fantastic and I highly recommend reading them NOW!!  One of my favorite couples Dean and Liv make an appearance here but the center of this amazing book is the stormy relationship between Kelsey and Archer.  I swallowed to ease the dryness in my throat.  Do you always let fate decisions for you?  Fate makes better decisions than I do.  Archer has always been a screwup an angry and rightfully so rootless man drifting from job to job and never able to commit to much.  He rides into the town of Mirror Lake already a changed man but his brother Dean only sees the old Archer the addict and the womanizer.  Enter Kelsey the tightlywound meteorology professor who needs to let go a little and who knows that Archer is everything she should avoid.  He could push me to my limits and protect me the entire time.  Kelsey and Archer immediately strike a deal agreeing to a temporary relationship while he is visiting with Dean and Liv.  Suffice it to say they both get more than they bargained for and both learn to see behind the others facade and get to whats real and honest.  All of this plays out against the almostfairytalelike setting of Mirror Lake which adds a very special magic to this incredibly sexy and adult story.  I must say that I absolutely love how Nina Lane can write about the world of college academics on the one hand and then turn around give us one of the dirtiesttalking characters EVER!  Phone sex hello!  Archer is all man commanding bossy and completely honest with Kelsey.  I found their relationship to be completely real and perfectly developed.  I also loved the way Archer and Deans relationship grew throughout this story and the way Archer really matured and came to terms with his past.  BREAK THE SKY is tender sexy funny and incredibly satisfying.  Another mustread from Ms.  Nina Lane!  ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review,5,False
383, Super hot!  This is my first book by Sawyer Bennett and I absolutely loved it!  Sugar on the Edge reminds me why I love reading contemporary romance.  It has emotion perfect pacing a lovely locale the Outer Banks of North Carolina a characterdriven story and BLAZING hot sex.  Gavin and Savannah are memorable real and totally drew me into their story.  I have not read the other books in the Last Call series so I can tell you that this one can absolutely be read as a standalone but now that I have sampled Ms.  Bennetts writing I will read them.  There are other characters from the previous books but they are fullywritten characters and I did not feel as though I was lost at all.  Gavin is in a lot of emotional pain and moves to North Carolina to finish writing a manuscript.  Hes sexy British and has a very dark side.  Savannah seems at first to be his total opposite  sweet hardworking yet smart and a little sassy.  I literally read this book in one sitting and recommend it as a perfect read if you want a hot sexy funny exciting and emotional story.  I highly recommend Sugar on the Edge and am adding Ms.  Bennetts other books to my TBR list immediately.  Enjoy!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
384, . Stars!  Colleen Hoover is a mustread author for me.  I always adore her books the stories the emotions the characters and Confess was no different.  This book is pure magic from the opening chapter to the very end.  Confess is an intricately woven tale from beginning to end where all of the characters are somehow connected and where everything is slowly revealed little by little.  I absolutely fell in love with Owen.  He is a gifted artist but has some very rocky relationships in his life.  I just knew that I would grow to love him even though he seemed like he made some questionable choices early on in the book.  Owen and Auburn are both very very complicated characters and my heart nearly broke for Auburn and her situation.  I could not put this story down and read it in practically one sitting.  I love you so much.  His voice is breathless and full of fear.  Ill love you forever.  Even when I cant.  My tears fall harder at his words.  And Ill love you forever.  Even when I shouldnt.  You should read this book without any spoilers because the plot is very clever and there are surprises thrown in along the way.  I love the creative plot and the paintings throughout the book are just magnificent.  They tie into the story perfectly.  I will confess that my ARC copy did not have the paintings so I bought a Kindle copy and I am so glad that I did.  The paintings are haunting and very revealing.  Even though this is a romantic story with some very emotional situations there are definitely moments of humor which I greatly appreciated!  Confess is another mustread from one of my absolute favorite authors.  It is a beautiful story about the power of trust and love and I didnt want Owen and Auburns story to end.  Enjoy!,5,False
385,  frothy and delicious stars!!  Loved this swoony very romantic story!  I absolutely love Melanie Harlows Frenched Series!  The heroines are strong witty sexy and very relatable.  Coco is thrown together with her ex Nick a wellknown chef who broke her heart years before.  She has never really gotten over him and it seems that even though he broke up with her he isnt over her either.  Melanie French writes sexy heroes who have a heart of gold a strong romantic streak and who arent afraid of strong women.  The sex scenes in this book are UBERhot and sweetly romantic at the same time.  Sometimes you need a sexy light and superromantic book in between some of the darker heavier reads and Forked fits the bill perfectly.  Put Nick and Coco on your reading menu you wont be disappointed!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review,4,False

As for My Hunger we see Mark dealing with the traumatic events surrounding Rebeccas disappearance as well as his mothers illness.

He is attempting to become Master to Crystal but she is very different from his other submissives.  Will he be able to fight their overwhelming attraction?  I loved their banter and sexual tension and Lisa Renee Jones is such a talented writer that she only makes me want more from Marks POV.  He is one of my favorite characters from the series.

387,  stars!!  Once in a while a book comes along that absolutely throws you for a loop and knocks your socks off and Im happy to say LOCK  KEY is one of those books.  A story about a yearold heroine who has sacrificed her whole life to the OneEyed Jacks MC LOCK  KEY is hot sexy thrilling perfectly written and filled with characters that I wont soon forget.  Grace and Lock meet right at the beginning of the story and sparks fly.  They are both damaged and not looking to connect with another human being on any kind of meaningful level.  They spend an incredibly HOT night together hello ice cube scene!!   thinking theyll never see each other again but boy are they dead wrong.  I fell in love with Lock he is one badass biker but he knows a good thing is right in front of him.  The problem is will he realize what a treasure Grace is before she slips away?  I had my dream on my hands and in my mouth and I never fucking realized.  This story is perfectly told in both a combination of flashbacks and alternating POVs.  The book unfolds like a flower petal layer by layer peeled away until the reader is left incredibly satisfied at the end.  This is a long and meaty book filled with plenty of drama and scorching hot sex scenes but I literally could not put it down until the very end.  Ms.  Porter has created a world of memorable characters Alpha bikers strong and feisty women and a solid story that will stay with me for a long time to come.  I highlighted half the book but instead I am borrowing the authors teasers.  This is an original and very creative story so I dont want to give any of the plot away.  Add Lock  Key to your TBR list immediately!  This is a mustread book for all fans of strong writing characters with backbone and beautiful stories about the importance of family and secondchance love.

388,  beautiful stars!  Why the war paint Pix?  Because I cant stand the girl underneath she whispered  Why the tattoos?  Lexi asked  Because I cant bear seeing the scars of my past.  Tillie Cole is a very gifted writer and this story is fascinating heartbreaking beautiful funny tender and wonderfully written.  This is not exactly your typical jockmeetsGothgirl story it is much richer and more nuanced than that and I really recommend you give this book a try.  You do not need to have read the other books in the series I did not but I plan to read them now to follow Lexi and Austins story.  Austin is the star player on the University of Alabamas football team and Lexi is part of the cheerleading squad.  But he is also a tattooed former gang member struggling to break free from his past.  She too has her own painful struggles that are handled with incredible sensitivity and care by Tillie Cole.  There were many times during this book that I was afraid something terrible would happen to Austin or Lexi and I read the story with my heart pounding.  Austin is a beautiful boy inside and out and showed great compassion and caring for others all hidden beneath his tattooed toughguy exterior.  Lexi struggles to keep it together even as all others see is an offbeat but talented cheerleader on a very tough college squad.  Sweet Fall is very much about not judging a book by its cover and not expecting others to conform to your idea of of perfect.  Acceptance of both yourself and of others is the message I took from this story and I applaud the author for writing about a very difficult and painful subject.  I highly recommend Sweet Fall and I can guarantee you will fall in love with Austin Carillo!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
389, Vanquish was not at all what I expected and is a painfully beautiful story of the redemptive power of love and devotion.  Yes I LOVE Van and for those of you who have read Deliver you know that he is twisted really fed up and obsessively possessively in love with Liv.  He seemed BAD through and through but I knew better!  I couldnt wait to read his story because I knew there was much more to him.  Vanquish totally blew me away.  It is really a story of two painfully lonely people who really only want to connect with another human being on the most basic of levels.  But this being a Pam Godwin story well you get two very effed up people tons of mindblowing sex and lots of danger thrown into the mix.  Pam Godwins writing is pure perfection.  There is no instaconnection the emotions are real and the sexual chemistry is explosive.  This book has it all.  And Amber broke my heart.  I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and I will devour every book she writes.  Vanquish is raw gritty beautiful suspenseful sexy and painful.  What more could you possibly ask for?,5,False
390, What an adult sexy and witty story!  Alice Clayton writes very realistic and humorous banter between Simon and Caroline and I laughed out loud through many parts of this book.  An added plus is the incredible chemistry between these two and the sexy times are absolutely hot and very satisfying!  This story is about reallife Simon and Caroline have realworld professions and work hard just like lots of outer couples to make their passionate relationship work.  Jobs friends family and yes even allseeing Clive all intervene into their blissful existence.  I loved the way Simon and Carolines relationship grows in this book.  They learn more about each other and their witty banter is funny and realistic.  Caroline has to make some tough decisions this book but all is done with good grace and humor.  There is no overthetop drama or contrived situations.  But Simon is absolutely still gorgeous sexy romantic and swoonwrothy and can still sweep Caroline off her feet.  I also loved all of the supporting characters and Simon and Carolines friends play a major role in Rusty Nailed.  I cant wait to read more about them in upcoming books in this series.  Rusty Nailed is everything you expect from Alice Clayton: intelligent witty dialogue steamy chemistry and true love and caring not only between Simon and Caroline but between all of their friends.  I cant wait for Screwdrivered!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
391, Vi Keeland is a favorite author of mine and I was excited to read her young adult romance written with Dylan Scott.  Both sweet and sexy at the same time Left Behind is a wonderful story of loss strength emotion and first love.  The story is very engaging and the characters are very real.  Nikki and Zacks story totally drew me in and once I started I read this book in one sitting.  Told in alternating POVs which actually become one story Left Behind tells the story of Nikki who relocates to California after the death of her mother.  Having lived a very lonely and sad life she is apprehensive about starting over.  But Nikki is very strong because she had to grow up at an early age.  She doesnt want anyones pity and just wants to be a normal teenager.  To her eyes Zack lives an almostperfect life with a stable family and seemingly happy home life.  But Zack has faced a terrible tragedy and is dealing with it in his own way.  Angry and guiltstricken he is confused over his feelings for Nikki.  There is a twist to this story that wasnt really a surprise but I was literally holding my breath through most of this book hoping against hope that nothing would come between Nikki and Zack!  The authors really hit a home run with Zack.  He took my breath away!  Zack is one incredibly sweet romantic and sexy guy.  I loved Zack and Nikki together.  I also love how this book dealt with some very adult subjects in a very sensitive way.  This book contained just the right mix of sexy romance and emotion.  Combined with the inventive story it is great young adult book.  ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
392, Each relationship was its own mess full of faults and flaws fighting every damn day to be worthy.  What a perfectly dark ending to one of my favorite dark romance series!  I read for escape and Monsters in the Dark offers just that.  Pepper Winters has created a dark sexy and highly erotic series with two unforgettable characters.  Tess and Q are both damaged flawed and perfectly matched for each other.  I adore this series and read this intense story almost in one sitting.  Q was born into darkness but hed never baptized me in his blackest desires.  And because of that I could implicitly say he spoke the truth.  No matter what he did to me he would never truly harm me.  Told in dual POVs this book is very very dark and offers some BDSM along with the highly unusual relationship between Tess and Q. Having settled into married life Q is hiding something from Tess that he fears will break them apart.  But Tess is strong brave and absolutely devoted to Q. She will let nothing and no one come between them!  We come alive when were together with no cages or locks between us.  Q is fascinating and irresistible.  I love him!!  JE SUIS A TOI is a very graphic story but it is truly Pepper Winters at her best.  Im very sad to see this series end but looking forward to what is next from this author!

393, . stars!!  Hot and sweet and funny.  This was my first book by Cardeno C. and I absolutely loved it!  This story is told in the very clever way of Chase/Charlie looking back over time and telling his story through the format of looking through a photo album of his life.  I adored this.  The story itself is a beautifullywritten mix of humor pain steam and sweetness.  I cant wait to read more from this author.  Charlie/Chase has always been true to himself which has not been easy for other men in his life.  I loved his honesty!  Although the book is told from three different POVs it is really Charlie who is the main character in this story.  Scott is his first love and their story is hot sweet and heartbreaking.  Scott moves away abruptly but remains the love of Charlies life.  Years later Charlie meets Adan and thinks that maybe he could love again.  The way these three eventually come together is both surprising and totally hot.  The character development is fantastic and the writing to me almost flawless.  I love reading how these three souls ultimately find a way to create a life thats right for them.  If you are in any kind of book slump read this book.  Its a pageturner and completely addictive.,4,False

He is a badass biker with a heart of gold trying his best to parent his son Z with a nogood exwife who is always causing problems.

395, . stars!!  Come in.  Sit anywhere but on the bed.  Dont look cute dont get undressed and dont touch my underwear.  I really loved the latest book in the Wild Seasons series!  It is very very funny had really hot scenes and a wonderful storyline.  Harlow is a funny smartass modern and smart heroine.  Finn is another nuanced sexy and loving leading man created by this fabulous writing duo.  This is not a cliched contemporary romance story but instead has some very serious themes woven into the story.  Harlow and Finn have lots of miscommunications throughout the story but their scenes together are fantastic and their chemistry feels real and genuine and never forced.  I truly thought that the authors could not top the first book in this series but Harlow and Finn are every bit as addictive as the characters from Sweet Filthy Boy.  These two are at opposite ends of the spectrum personalitywise but their banter and sexy times are hilarious and very very hot.  Dont miss this book.  It is a wonderful passionate and very funny read with lots and lots of heart.

397, OMG!!!  Expect even MORE surprises and twists from E.K.  Blair!!!  Never in a million years did I see these developments coming.  A tense thriller but with the deep unbreakable love between Declan and Elizabeth at the center of the story.  I never gave up on life  because of him  I kept going  because of him  Hush is the last installment in the very dark story of characters that I will not soon forget.  If you have waited until all the books are out in this series well wait no more!  I highly recommend this highly imaginative and incredibly twisted series.  All of the hype surrounding these books is very welldeserved in my opinion.  Nina/Elizabeth Declan Bennett Pike...I grew to care deeply about each and every one.  I will never forget this conclusion to this series.  While I am saddended that this is the end of the series I cannot wait to see what E.K.  Blair dreams up next.  If you have read the first two books you know that Elizabeth has lived through unimaginable suffering.  BANG the first book in this series is one of my top favorite books ever.  The emotions the thrills and the incredible darkness in that book left me reeling.  The characters have come full circle here and although the author certainly stays true to the dark nature of the series the ending was perfect for these characters.  We are monsters and lovers animals and killers but nothing can extinguish what we have when were together.  As I was coming to the ending of HUSH I thought Where is the author going with this?  There are only a few more pages left!  GAH!!  E.K.  Blair never takes the easy way out and she remained fiercely honest to each of her characters in this series.  Sympathies will be challenged and emotions will be tested in HUSH.  I am being vague because there is an incredibly risky and very surprising conclusion to this series and it must be experienced firsthand while reading without knowing any spoilers.  Dont skip to the end!!  It has been days since I finished this book and these characters are still filling my head and my heart.  Dont miss HUSH and dont miss the BLACK LOTUS Series.  You wont soon forget these stories.  The ugliest parts of you are your darkest.  And trust me when I tell you that I want to love all of your darkest parts.

Anything I say here about any of the characters that appeared in BANG might give the plot of ECHO away so...if you like dark twisty psychosexual thrillers than ECHO should be at the top of your mustread lists.

I cannot describe what goes on in ECHO other than to say READ THIS BOOK!!  You will be thrilled heartsick turned on and excited all at once.  Your emotions will run rampant after reading this book.

399, I really liked this book it is funny dirty and is the kind of book that you cant look away from.  The authors warning caught my attention there is a TON of swearing in this book but it is also really funny and not at all what I expected.  This is not your typical high school drama Bronagh and Dominic fight like cats and dogs which is kind of like their foreplay.  She is also feisty likable curses all the time and has some body issues.  I loved her!  The relationship between the two main characters is unpredictable and fresh.  I also absolutely loved all the Slater Brothers and look forward to reading more about their exploits.  This book is written in Irish dialect which the author explains right out of the box.  I enjoyed it but it might be a little much for some readers to digest.  This book is also hilarious and contains more F words than I think any book I have ever read.  Dominic has some very endearing characters and totally hot sex scenes.  I guarantee this book is different from any book you have read so far this year!  Give it a try if you love strong heroines and gorgeous Alpha fighters.  There is also a ton of action making this a fastpaced sexy and funny read.

401, . Stars!  Reviewed by Cathy:  Push is not our usual read which by the way I loved.  This is a fdup love story to say the least.  You might think youve heard that before but honestly you have never read a story like PUSH before.  I wont go into detail about the plot because this book is best read without knowing too much about the storyline.  Going in blind to this book is so much more thrilling!  Emma is moving on from her past and horrible stepfather and two brothers who were manipulated by him.  Shes had a rough life.  She is starting over on her own which is very freeing for her.  She meets David they day she moves into her in apartment.  He is the handyman for the building and was sent by the owner to fix her kitchen which is a mess.  She opens her door hesitantly unsure of whether hes telling the truth or whether he is just a psycho.  My anxiety attack began when she opened the door.  You will need tranquilizers for this story!!  It does end with a cliffhanger and I told myself No!  It cant end like this!  But PUSH is so wellwritten that it is like a breath of fresh air.  Get ready for a lovehate relationship with one of the characters.  This is an excellent summer read!  PUSH should be receiving more attention and acclaim because its that good!

403, . Stars  very very addictive  really loved Naz in all his dark and tortured glory.  He is my favorite part of this story and is a very very complex character.  For all of his very very bad equalities and there are many he really loves Karissa and will let nothing stand in the way of keeping her safe.  This is a very twisty story that begins in Book  and is part intense love story and part suspense story.  Torture to Her Soul was a tiny bit slow for me midway through the story only because I have such high esteem for J.D.  Darhower and her storytelling abilities.  But the characters and the story are really fantastic and Mafia romances are one of my favorites genres.  So I completely loved Naz even when I hated him.  This entire story is solely from Nazs POV and is a fascinating look inside his very dark mind.  I could not wait for this conclusion to the incredible story from Monster in His Eyes and it did not disappoint.  A mustread for all fans of darker romance.  Favorite quote:  Im not a good man he says but Im trying.  Im trying.  I cant make you any promises of perfection.

404, Until Nico is the fourth book in a series but it can be read as a standalone I have not yet read the first three books and I still thoroughly enjoyed Nico!!  All of the other characters play a role in the story but the author did a great job at making this purely Nico and Sophies story.  I absolutely LOVED the dirtytalking possessive and sweet Nico!  I was surprised at the quick way they met and fell for each other as I am not usually a fan of Instalove.  But it worked perfectly here.  You know the moment I saw you I knew you were the one for me I say gently watching her eyes get big.  Youre mine Sophie.  Every beautiful inch of you is mine.  Nico is the loveemandleaveem type.  He is also very familyoriented sexy as hell and willing to take his time sort of with the shy and closedoff Sophie.  The sex scenes are AMAZING and offthecharts steamy!  I know what I want.  I always get what I want.  And thats the last thought in my head before I fall asleep.  Until Nico has really strong characters a very sweet storyline and because Nico is a bounty hunter there is of course lots of action thrown in.  I really liked this story and am looking forward to reading the first three books in this series!,4,False
405, Someone special once told me to dare to dream.  For without dreams we have nothing to look forward to.  Im starting to believe her.  The Resistance completely took me by surprise with its perfect writing passionate and heartfelt characters and absolutely fantastic sexy times!!  This is the first book I have read by S.L.  Scott and I cant wait to read her other novels.  I went into this blind and was drawn right into the fastpaced story of Holliday and Jack.  Thank God for a smart strong heroine!  I am so tired of weak cookiecutter heroines and Holli was a breath of fresh air.  She created her own business and the corporate side of this story was very realistic and not overdramatized like many books have done lately.  So thank you Ms.  Scott for that.  Holli doesnt need anyone shes lonely but wrapped up in growing her business.  So Jack Dalton is the last person she expects to fall for when she attends a convention in Las Vegas.  They have immediate chemistry but he is actually a very sensitive lonely guy who also looking for a deeper connection than his usual parade of onenight stands.  Trust me this book is so wellwritten that I lost myself in the words and read this in almost  day.  I wish I would have read The Resistance slower!  The storyline is also rich with other characters and of course lots and lots of hot sex.  I must feel that the main characters are emotionally connected to each other and the author succeeds on all levels.  I as a reader also must feel a connection to the characters and I really cared about Jack and Holli.  Their dialogue is witty they both grow emotionally during the story and I cant say anything negative at all about The Resistance.  I absolutely love a rock star story that explores the perils of fame and excess and this book also does that perfectly.  A mustread by an author to watch!,5,False
406, .   UNFORGETTABLE STARS!  If the mark of a good book is that you cant stop thinking about it then CORRUPT is a winner.  I love dark books but even I was close to not finishing this one due to the darkness and rage that filled the early part of the book.  But what a story!!!  Dark sexy thrilling actionpacked...and filled with twists and turns that took this cynical dark romance reader by surprise.  Let me be clear that if Penelope Douglas wrote a grocery list I would read it.  BULLY is one of my favorite books and her new contemporary romance MISCOUNDUCT is one of the best books Ive read this year.  So theres my disclaimer!  If you are looking for a gripping edgeofyourseat book then CORRUPT is for you.  It is rough it is scary it is sexy...but it is ultimately incredibly thrilling and emotionally satisfying.  And the sex scene near the end of the book?  Holy moly.  Kudos to you Ms.  Douglas you thrilled even this jaded erotica reader.  AS I was reading I couldnt help but fear for Rika and the dire circumstances she found herself in.  But shes an unusual female protagonist in that she literally could give as good as she got and she never ever once cowered or allowed herself to be overpowered by the Four Horsemen.  I still think about all of these characters weeks after finishing this book.  And that to me is what makes a good book great.  CORRUPT is not your average dark romance.  It is really a standout book.  Highly highly recommended.  FAVORITE QUOTE:  Redefine normal.  None of us know the full measure of our power until we start pushing our boundaries and pressing our luck and the more we do the less we care what others think.  The freedom feels too good.,5,False
407, . stars!!  What an addictive and enjoyable story!  Nicola Haken is a new author for me and I will definitely read more of her books.  Being Sawyer Knight is not only an incredibly hot and sexy story it is also filled with plenty of tender and emotional moments and a beautiful message about learning to love and accept yourself.  Sawyer Knight is a worldfamous musician who longs for people to see the real him and not just his rockstar stage persona.  He has very little to do with his mother and had an abusive stepfather who was only interested in Sawyers fame as a musician.  He hasnt spoken to his best friend Jake since they were teenagers when Sawyer could not deal with Jake making his true feelings known for Sawyer.  Jake has followed Sawyers career and is the only person who has ever really known the real Sawyer.  He comes back into Sawyers life as his bodyguard and is still very much in love with Sawyer.  Now he just has to convince Sawyer that they belong together.  The chemistry between these two is literally explosive and burns up the pages!  I absolutely fell in love with Jake and his bossy dominating ways.  He cannot stay away from Sawyer but will Sawyer admit his true feelings for Jake?  This book is told in dual POVs which I thought worked great.  There is a side plot involving death threats to the band but to me it is the scorching hot sex scenes between Jake and Sawyer that made this book come alive.  Nicola Haken is an incredibly talented writer and I devoured this book almost in one sitting.  There is also a beautiful love story at the heart of this book and I was sad to see Jake and Sawyers story end!  I cant wait to read Ryders story which is coming up next.

408, Reviewed by Cathy for The Book Bellas I was really surprised how much I liked this book.  From the start I was having palpitations.  You know when youre reading and youre waiting for a disaster to happen?  That was me.  I empathized with the main character right from the Prologue.  This is my kind of book  Louis is  wealthy hot a womanizer with a really foul mouth.  What more can you ask for?  Emily is  years old and meets Louis while filling in as a waitress for her sisters catering job.  She cant keep her eyes off this magnetic man who has every women salivating for him.  She notices that his eyes are following her the entire time.  But he just leaves that night without saying a word to her.  Her obsession starts from that day.  All she does is fantasze about him.  Louis hired her sisters company for more parties.  She find out its him and signs up to work the jobs.  Louis approaches her and lets her know how he cant stop thinking about her and how much he wants her.  They go out for coffee and dinner but he is so cocky that she sets him straight and from there on he switches because he realizes just because shes young shes not a push over.  Their obsession for each grows they cant be without each other.  They are consumed with one another.  She lives for only him.  He changes his lifestyle for her stops sleeping around and breaks up the the boys his best friends.  Will his past interfere and her insecurities doom them?  The sex scenes were great.

409, One word: glorious!  Thank the gods for Mia Sheridan!  Becoming Calder is so very beautiful my heart was overflowing in some parts and breaking in others.  This story is completely original and the characters are so brave and honest that I was lost in this book from beginning to end.  Calder and Edens story is very unconventional and is very painful in parts.  But their bond is so strong and passionate that I just knew that they would be able to withstand any heartache and pain that came their way.  I feel very strongly about the type of community that Eden and Calder lived in and many scenes were almost too painful to read.  I feel that the author absolutely nailed the psychological and physical abuse so accurately that it blew me away.  This story unfolds layer by layer with the reader joining in Calders slowly dawning realization that he and his family did NOT in fact live in a paradise.  We hadnt chosen this life.  It had chosen us.  Calder and Edens love is almost magical.  But there is plenty of offthecharts heat and longing between them to satisfy every contemporary romance reader.  The story has tons of twists and turns and there are so many obstacles thrown at Calder and Eden that I was afraid they wouldnt survive.  Where do you find your strength Morning Glory he had asked me.  From you I had said smiling and pulling him close.  Try to read this book without reading too many reviews with spoilers.  Becoming Calder is passionate refreshingly original and completely satisfying.  A mustread!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
410,  stars!!  Stayed up all night reading!!  Many thanks to the author for the ARC because once I started reading I absolutely could not put it down.  Karissa is a poor college student struggling in particular with a Philosophy class.  The professor is a jerk and if she gets a low grade in the class she will lose her scholarship.  Naz and Clarissa meet by chance outside the classroom when he stops to pay a visit to her professor.  He is the quintessential bad boy but a wealthy one and slowly begins to sweep Karissa off her feet.  She leads a very quiet and simple life and finds herself falling hard for the incredibly sexy and overwhelming Naz.  This is NOT the standard innocentgirlmeetsolderrichguy trope instead there are INCREDIBLE twists and some scorching hot sex!  Naz is a bad boy but he really does treat Karissa like a princess.  There is an undercurrent of uneasiness and dread during this book but it is not until the last part of the book that the incredibly shocking plot twists are revealed.  I cant wait for the next book and as for Naz Well step aside ladies this ones on me!,5,False
411, WOW!  If the rest of the Bend Anthology is this smoking hot and unexpected then it will become one of my favorite reads of .  UnRaveled is darkly delicious sensual highly erotic and very very sexy.  This is not your usual erotica story it is has some absolutely yummy twists and turns that satisfied even this most jaded of dark erotica readers.  Ms.  Bromberg has devoted as much thought and care to this novella as she does to her fulllength series.  This is no Driven this is a completely separate new story from an extremely talented writer.

412, Emma Chase is one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I absolutely loved getting a Drew POV.  Ms.  Chase is a master mistress?  at writing a sexy sarcastic and funny male POV and Tied does not disappoint!  Drew is funny smart honest and totally lovable.  Drew and Kate and their friends all take a trip to Las Vegas before their wedding.  And of course theres a million ways that this trip could go south.  One of my favorite things about this series is how the characters speak directly to the reader and Tied delivers all of the things I adore about this series plus more.  Its funny poignant and sexy all in one.  And there are some really beautiful sentiments about marriage and commitment too.  Awwww!  This is a light easy totally fun read and is a delicious end to a beloved series.  I am going to miss Drew and Kate!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False

414,  STARS!!!  This book HOOKED me from the first page until the very end.  The author has given me another great love with M and the story to me was every bit as gripping and gutwrenching as Jesse and Avas story.  I was SO excited to read an early copy of this book!!  One Night: Promised is a star read for me and it is NOT to be missed.  Livy is a very relatable woman a bit of an underachiever but working hard to put her past dysfunctional family life behind her.  She leads a rather quiet and sad life.  At first she resists the mysterious stranger who visits her coffee shop but M is nothing if not persistent and she finds herself accepting his very risky proposition  spend just one glorious night together.  I know a bad thing when I see it and standing behind me is a man who could crush my logic.  M is HOT and if you think this is a standard romance story you are WRONG.  M is nuanced damaged and yes ultimately very lovable and Livy falls hard.  This book has a TON of twists and heartstopping turns so this review will be spoilerfree.  The story is filled with fantastic memorable characters including a wonderful supporting cast of friends and the amazing funny and incorrigible Nan Livys grandmother.  Livy has blocked off her emotions for a very long time but she cannot resist Ms nostringsattached proposition.  He makes her feel alive BUT she does push back at certain points in the story which I found to be very believable and true to her character.  M has many many faults and he turns out to be a very flawed very human character.  I fell in love with him immediately.  Ive always tried to keep my life simple but now Im craving a complication  a tall darkhaired mysterious complication.  I absolutely LOVED the gentlemanly formal side of M. It fit in perfectly with his personality.  This book has a slow build to it but you will be generously rewarded by sticking to the story.  The author  thrilled me to my very soul by the end of the book.  M to me is a actually a very loving person wrapped up in a stunningly handsome rather cold exterior.  He makes makes a real effort to be close to Livy to treasure her and care for her in his own way.  Beautiful things should be savored Livy not rushed.  Overall One Night: Promised is one of my top reads of the year so far.  I absolutely cannot wait for November!  Each and every moment will be etched on that beautiful mind of yours forever.  Every kiss.  Every touch.  Every word.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.  Check out our interview with Jodi Ellen Malpas at The Book Bellas,5,False
415, Joint review for this one.  Cathy:   stars!  Jodi Ellen Malpas is a genius at making you feel sorry for her Alpha male even though he is so fd up and knowing the heroine should RUN not walk the other way!  I wanted Livy to stay and fight for Miller.  And the authors phrasing is absolutely epic.  I fell in love with the characters all over again in this book and wanted more.  I adored One Night Denied.  I felt that Ms.  Malpas really tapped into Millers emotions and even though I believe that we really dont know his whole story yet I was okay with the parts of his past that the author revealed.  I loved this book even more than the first one and I cannot wait for the third book.  Ellen:  . stars!  I absolutely fell in love with Miller Hart all over again.  This book begins right after Book  so there will be no spoilers here.  The passion and the intensity that Miller feels for Livy were the best parts of the book for me.  My heart broke for him in this book and I was praying that Livy would get beyond her own painful past and let Miller love her.  This is a man truly and deeply in love and he would let nothing and no one stand in his way.  That is one of the many things that I love about the authors tortured heroes.  Im madly fascinated by you Olivia Taylor.  You fill my dark world with light and my hollow heart with feelings.  Ive persistently informed you that Ill never go down easily.  While I was not as obsessed with this book as I was with One Night: Promised I absolutely loved it and I am very impatiently waiting for the next installment in Miller and Livys story.  Jodi Ellen Malpas remains one of my favorite contemporary romance authors and I treasure every word she writes.  Thanks to the publisher for an ARC of One Night: Denied,5,False
416, If you love a hardworking sexy but sweet cowboy and a feisty heroine you will love Rising Assets!  This was my first book by Rebecca Zanetti and I loved it!

418, Fantastic story for fans of dark romance!  Torrent took me by surprise and didnt let go of my heart until the last word.  I need Book !  Rafe is one of the most dangerous but most sympathetic characters Ive come across in a long time.  I can absolutely see why Alex has been in love with him since she was a young girl.  She has lived a very rough life perfect from the outside but tortured behind closed doors.  She has had to endure unimaginable abuse both emotional and physical.  Heed the warnings on this book the story is a rough one but it is incredibly wellwritten totally sexy and has a fantastic creative plot.  I loved the dual POVs which were a great way to garner sympathy for even an unsympathetic character.  This is a story of obsession lust love and revenge and I loved every word.  Gemma James has now become a click author for me.  She has created a world that I did not want to leave once I finished Torrent and isnt that the best form of escapism?  The ending will leave you reeling and dying for the next book in this series.  Not sure I can wait until release and I have already ordered the next book!  I am not giving anything away as far as the plot goes because Torrent should be enjoyed without knowing any plot spoilers.  Grab this one if you are a fan of dark sexy reads with a strong Alpha male you will not be disappointed.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
419, . SMOKING HOT stars!  Um...wow...what did I just read?  If It Drives is handsdown my favorite book in the Market Garden series.  This story focuses on Red Tie guy the wealthy banker James Harcourt.  His driver Cal has a crush on James and wants to figure out why James keeps going back to Market Garden when Cal is available and literally right in front of his face.  One night they cross over the employer/employee line and what a night it is!  But something seems lacking and Cal feels that he cant quite give James what he really needs.  Cal then embarks on a journey to explore his own Dom side and he and James have some smoking hot scenes together.  But will James realize that Cal wants more than meaningless onenight stands?  If It Drives turned into a quite tender and lovely romance between Cal and James in between all the scorching hot scenes.  I absolutely loved the development of their Dominant/submissive relationship and did I mention the sex scenes BURN UP up the page?  I also loved the emotional connection between the characters and Cals inner dialogue.  He came across as surprisingly thoughtful and sweet an interesting mix with his Dom tendencies.  This is a fantastic addition to the Market Garden series and I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a gutsy sexy and surprisingly emotional love story.,4,False
420, Tessa Bailey is known for writing the dirtiesttalking Alphas around.  This book was released under Entangled Embrace so its not quite as dirty but I absolutely loved it!  This is Willa and Shanes story.  Willa first appeared in Protecting Whats His from the authors Line of Duty series and I have been looking forward to her story ever since we met Gingers younger sister.  Willa has won a photography contest and the prize is a trip to Ireland.  She has broken up with her boyfriend and is tortured over whether she did the right thing.  She is met at the airport by her ride to the bedandbreakfast none other than the handsome sexy and apparently very angry Shane.  He is none to happy to be burdened with fetching Willa from the airport and they immediately argue.  She stands up to him which most people do not do and fireworks ensue.  Unfixable is a sexy layered and nuanced story that captured my attention from the beginning to end.  Tortured sexy Irishman with a soft heart?  Check.  Beautifully described Irish locales?  Check.  Troubled insecure and beautiful heroine?  Check!  Add some really hot and sexy times and you have a perfect romance novel.  The characters are all incredibly wellwritten Shane and Willa both have issues that they must come to terms with and above it all this book has real heart.  I absolutely love Tessa Baileys books and will read anything this woman writes.  If you want a perfect escapist story then Unfixable is the book for you.,5,False
421, . stars!!  Sweet Filthy Boy is the first book in Wild Seasons a new series from these authors and if the next books are anything like this one this will be an AMAZING series!  I really didnt expect to love Sweet Filthy Boy as much as I did but the story and the characters drew me right in and this book far exceeded my expectations.  This book starts out with a twist and builds from there.  Mia and her friends go to Las Vegas after college graduation as a gift from the parents of one of the friends.  Mia is determined to let loose for a weekend before she follows her fathers wishes and heads off the graduate business school in Boston.  She gets more than she bargained for after one wild night with the gorgeous sexy but ohsosensitive Ansel who is visiting from France.  Mia decides to spend the summer with Ansel in France.  This book really transports the reader to the different locales and I loved being lost in the story.  Las Vegas San Diego Paris... the cities each almost became another character in the book.  I absolutely fell in love with Ansel and the sexy times in this story are SMOKING HOT off the charts!  The writing is perfection and I want to get to know all of the characters better!  I really wasnt sure how this book was going to turn out and I was glued to the pages until the very end.  I loved this book I loved Ansel and cant wait for more in this series!

422, I liked this installment better than the first one!  Andrew still cant get enough of Aubrey and she is still dealing with her very dysfunctional family.  This is a quick read and sat on my currentlyreading shelf forever.  I cant wait for the next installment because this one ends abruptly and Im dying to know what happened to Andrew to make him so screwed up when it comes to women and relationships.  Loved the sex scenes this is a quick and steamy read with good character development.  Hurry up Whitney!!!  Im dying here!,4,False
423, This novella gets  stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue and  star for the often laughable supporting storyline.  There are so many completely madeup details in this story that would never ever happen in real life and would land the main characters in a real courtroom that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters.  I did love the alternating POVs but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me.  This is pure escapist fantasy that can be read in just one sitting.  The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.,3,False
424, Bang is the kind of book that will make you say WOW when you finish.  This review will be very vague on details because Bang absolutely must be read without any spoilers  this story will simply take you on a wild roller coaster ride from start to finish.  All of these authors books are beautifully written but in my opinion Bang is the best book she has written so far.  I dont know where she dreamed up this storyline from but it is gripping erotic gutwrenching suspenseful and incredibly creative all at once.  I fell in love with all of the characters and was blown away by the fantastic story.  Bang is an absolute mustread!  It is highly erotic and very very dark.  And yes the ending will totally leave you guessing as to what happens next.  I miss these characters and cant wait for the next book in this series!

425,  TimeIsPreciousStars!  I have a confession to make: I read this book a while ago and have simmered over what I could possibly write that would do justice to this unexpectedly sexy warmhearted and funny story.  Slow Burn was nothing that I expected from Ms.  Bromberg and it totally took me by surprise and blew me away!  Ah Becks and Haddie.  If you think you know them from the Driven Trilogy you will see them in a whole new light in Slow Burn.  With that being said this book can absolutely be read and enjoyed as a standalone.  Becks and Haddie had one night together and he knows in his heart that he wont be able to stay away from Haddie even though she presents a toughasnails exterior to the world.  He sees the real her.  I read this book literally on the edge of my seat and I have never appreciated Ms.  Brombergs brand of humor more!  Favorite quotes:  Time is precious.  Waste it wisely.  I just figured you were having some regression pussy.  Whenever I dont want to deal... I go and have meaningless sex to not think about it.  Slut glut I believe is my term for it.  Slow burn my ass.  More like fire in the goddamn hole.  Goddmann estrogen vortex.  Slow Burn will make you laugh cry and SWOON.  Its a mustread and is destined to become another beloved contemporary romance from K. Bromberg.,5,False
426,  heartstopping stars!  Oh Mia what have you done to my heart?  If you have read Mia Ashers first book ARSEN then you know she is a master storyteller taking the reader down one path and then surprising you with a twist that you didnt see coming.  And that is exactly the way I felt when reading EASY VIRTUE.  This book drew me in grabbed me and didnt let go!  I read this incredibly HOT book almost in one sitting.  Blaire seems unlikeable cold and calculating from the outside but she really is a product of her sad childhood and massive insecurities that have shaped her adult life.  Is she really capable of real love?  I think so but you have to read this gem of a book for yourself to find out.  I absolutely fell in love with Ronan he seems the perfect match for Blaire and he might be the one to show her true love.  There are lots of twists and turns in this book and it should be read without reading any spoilers.  It is the kind of book that warrants a reread because there are hints dropped here and there about the future of the story.  Make no mistake this is an incredibly sexy and fastpaced read and will have you turning the pages until the very end.  My only complaint: I NEED MORE RONAN NOW!!  Highly recommended!

427,  stars!  Rex took my breath away.  A mustread!  This incredible book begins with this beautiful dedication:  To every child who waited for a savior that never came.  You dont need to be a fan of fighter books to absolutely cherish this heartbreaking and ultimately incredibly uplifting story of Rex and Georgia.  Fighting for Flight is one of my top reads so far of  and stayed with me long after I finished.  This book paints a vividly detailed picture of the heartbreaking pasts of Rex and Georgia.  He was in foster care with her but he had a nightmarish childhood that haunts him in expected ways as an adult.  He is troubled both sexually and emotionally and can never quite put his finger on what is at the root of his problems.  He does know that he is attracted to the somewhat elusive new friend.  Rex is both a singer in a band and a fighter.  While he cant recall his childhood she holds the key to his past and while she is desperately trying to correct her past mistakes and alleviate some of the crushing guilt she has carried with her for her entire life she doesnt always go about it in the best way.  Assumptions are made hearts are broken beautiful words are spoken...and during this incredible book I absolutely fell in love with Rex.  The pain.  Its the only thing that reminds me Im alive.  When most of the time I wish I were dead.  Georgia understands Rex on a very deep and intimate level and their scenes together are breathtaking!  I was blown away by the incredible intimacy and deep emotional connection Ms.  Salsbury created between the two characters a connection that is often missing for me in most books.  The author doesnt try to gloss over Rexs horrific childhood.  His presentday obsessivecompulsive disorder is honestly dealt with and very detailed.  I loved the fact that Rex was also a musician and his lyrics are testament to the authors incredible writing talent and creativity:  Vivid dreams different faces  Waves of hate and lust in traces  Festering sickness my insides rot  Theres no pill for what Ive got.  Fighting to Forget is a mustread.  It has steam unforgettable characters a heartbreaking storyline intensity creativity and emotion.  Do not miss this one!!  Jamie Salsbury has become my new click author and I cant wait for more books in this series.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
428, This dark and fantastic story completely and utterly thrilled me and captivated me from the very first page.  Our heroine Nila is a successful fashion designer although she has led a somewhat sheltered life which actually plays quite nicely into the storyline.  On the night of her big runway show she encounters Jethro Hawk and she senses immediately that her life will change.  And does it ever.  That was my last day of freedom.  The last day that was my own.  As a huge Pepper Winters fan I absoultely loved this mindf of a story and the dark elements did not disturb me but only enthralled me.  It seems as though the demanding Jethro has no redeeming qualities but I feel there are hints of much more to come about this mysterious man in the future installments.  He fascinated me.  The story is quite twisty and yes somewhat fantastical but this is a true pageturner no doubt about it.  One mistake six hundred years ago put a curse on her entire family.  One mistake sold her life to me in a mountain of unpayable debt.  I inherited her.  I preyed on her.  I owned her life and had the piece of paper to prove it.  I absolutely loved this book and urge you to give it a try.  Yes there is a cliffhanger but the story is so wellwritten it is truly one of a kind ad not to be missed.,5,False
429,  stars.  Absolute perfection!  Seriously how can I even begin to discuss a book that has shot to the top of my list of favorite books ever?  Colleen Hoover has written another magical perfect story that will grab your heartstrings and will not let go until the very end.  I have to make this review intentionally vague because there is a major plot twist in Maybe Someday that must be experienced firsthand and should not be known before you start reading this book.  Sometimes in life we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.  Truer words were never spoken.  Sydney and Ridges story was like nothing I have read before.  And Maybe Someday is SO much more than just a book there is a gorgeous soundtrack that accompanies the story and makes this an unforgettable reading and listening experience.  Ridge is handsdown my new favorite book boyfriend.  Ms.  Hoover has taken a familiar genre and created an imaginative and unexpected story that surprised and thrilled me and left me with a serious book hangover after finishing.  This book is perfection and it is an absolute mustread!  ARC obtained from NetGalley,5,False
430, . stars  Wow!  A true m/m contemporary romance with two gorgeous loving and confident men!  I loved this book.  I read a lot of m/m books and Always was a refreshingly different and wonderful story!  I was hooked from the first glance between Avery and Kane and read this beautifully written book almost in one sitting.  Although I am not a fan of instalove the author handled the stunning attraction between Avery and Kane in a fantastic way in Always.  Once these two met there was no turning back.  Kane could feel his soul being extracted from his body.  His heart followed no longer his own but given to this man he didnt even know.  In a matter of a few short minutes he had become one with this man in from of him.  These two embark on a wonderful journey together and Ms.  Alexander handles their lives with beauty and grace.  Oh and the sex scenes are absolutely some of the steamiest I have ever read.  These two have a chemistry that jumps right off the page!  I needed a cold shower after reading this book.  Ill keep this review spoilerfree because there are some major surprises that I did not see coming and this book should be read without knowing the plot twists.  Even if you are not a fan of the m/m contemporary romance genre I highly recommend giving this book a try.  It is lushly written and completely satisfying in terms of the emotional connection between the two main characters.  I fell in love with Kane and Avery and I already miss them!  I cant wait to read more of Kindle Alexanders books!,4,False
431, . stars!!  Ridge was much more than I expected and I really loved this book!  We first met Ridge in Wild Book  but this is a standalone book and you do not need to read Wild first.  Ridge slept with his brothers fiancee Mia but they really never intended to hurt anyone.  They really love each other but Ridge is consumed by guilt over his relationship with his brother so he suddenly breaks up with Mia in an effort to repair his relationship with his brother.  Ridge battled addictions most of his life and breaking up with Mia sends him into a downward spiral.  He had a very very rough past including drugs and spending time in juvenile detention among other things.  Ridge has now become a successful restaurant owner but his pain over Mia pulls him into a very very dark place.  He tries to have other relationships but no one can compare to Mia.  Even when he was a jerk to everyone I loved him!  He was never intentionally hurtful and really wanted to make things right.  Mia had every right not to care about Ridge but even after he broke her heart she really tries to do the right thing.  I loved how she was a multidimensional character and seemed very real to me.  Oh and the sex!  It is HOT AS HELL .  I mean really dirty scorching hot sex scenes.  I applaud you Ms.  Wild!  I literally read this book in a few hours.  It is the kind of book where you cant tear your eyes away from what is happening in front of you.  If you like a downanddirty story with flawed characters you will love Ridge.

433, . stars!  Maverick.  Yes please!  This novel starts off with a bang and hooked me from the first page.  Maverick is a HOT AS HELL Navy SEAL a womanizer but determined to change for Windsor.  Their relationship is romantic sweet scorching hot and challenging.  There is a great cast of supporting characters and the story is very engaging.  There is also just the right amount of angst.  Crazy Good is the perfect book when you want a steamy read with some sweet romance and emotion thrown in.  I LOVED Mav!  Rachel Robinson is an author to watch and I look forward to reading more from her!,4,False
434, Love.  What else is love if not the power to destroy?  After Dark brings the fantastically addictive Night Owl trilogy to an incredibly satisfying conclusion.  And what a finale it is!  We are now witness to the somewhat normal living arrangements of Matt and Hannah as they return to real life after the tumultuous events of the first two books.  Their relationship continues to be beautifully sexy erotic and passionate.  Make no mistake After Dark is incredibly hot dirty and lusty.  Matt is irresistible!  If not very maddening.  ...little secrets are like water but if water gets into a rock and freezes it can break the rock.  Hannah and Matt both struggle in After Dark to reach a level of closeness and honesty that is sometimes brutal to witness yet real honest and emotional.  I love how both Matt and Hannah have grown and matured over the course of the trilogy without one false note.  The plot in the final book is refreshing and a complete pageturner.  I will admit that I am distraught that this trilogy has ended one of my alltime favorites hands down but I was absolutely entranced by the conclusion and the Epilogue.  After Dark is a moody erotic sensual story that is a mustread book.  Fingers crossed for many more books from the extraordinarily talented M. Pierce!

435, . stars!  I love picking up a book and being totally surprised and enthralled by a new author.  I could not put down Besieged once I started.  It is ubersexy scorchingly hot but with a fantastic story that kept my attention until the last page and left me dying for more from this author!  Warning: the build up to these two having sex is just as hot as when they actually get together and this book requires a cold shower or two!  My favorite kind of book!  Theo is a wealthy London businessman and Lilly works for his solicitor lawyer in the U.S..  Shes smart sarcastic funny and dropdead sexy.  Alhtough this might sound a tad familiar the author really does a great job with Lilly and Theos story as well as with making the city of London a character in the book.  I absolutely loved the club scenes as well as the wellwritten supporting cast of family and friends.  Lilly and Theo have some FHOT scenes and they literally cannot keep their hands off each other.  Theo is a confirmed bachelor he has never even wanted to spend any time at all with a woman let alone commit to anyone.  Lilly only uses guys for sex so they enter into a nostringsattached sexual relationship.  But Lilly makes Theo fight for her at first shes stubborn feisty and also very funny.  Shes no pushover and is painfully aware of his player status.  Theo cant resist Lilly and what I loved about him is that he is totally honest with her.  When he begins to develop real feelings for her he puts himself on the line and does not play games.  Never have I gone to such lengths over a woman.  Im having to convince her that she wants me for gods sake.  I close my eyes and I can hear her moaning as I taste that sweet pussy of hers.  Her cries as she trembles against my tongue.  Oh god.  My cock stiffens immediately at the memory.  I realise that now I know what it is to have her...I cant go back.  I will fight for her no matter what.  All in all I highly recommend this fantastic sexy debut by L.P.  Lovell.  Its modern totally hot and has characters that I really care about and who I really bonded with.  The only thing keeping this from being a star read for me was the pacing and editing which will probably go unnoticed by most readers but interrupted the flow for me.  I was thrilled to read that this author will be paying closer attention next time and I absolutely cannot wait for the next book in this series.  Grab Besieged let it take you on a sexy trip to London and enjoy!  ARC kindly provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
436, . stars!!  There is nothing quite like an Abbi Glines book.  I absolutely love the Florida Panhandle settings the alwayssurprising and juicy story lines and the steamy sexy scenes.  Of course I LOVE Rush and Blaire so I was excited to read more about Grant from the Rosemary Beach series.  And even though I am not filled with hate for Nan sorry I can see a little tiny bit of good in everyone!  I was completely on Harlows side in this supersexy installment in the Rosemary Beach series.  Leave it to Abbi Glines to give us yet another absolutely irresistible surprisingly thoughtful leading man in Grant.  The sweet and beautiful Harlow didnt have a chance with Grant around.  I loved getting inside Grants head to learn what his possible motivations could be in sleeping with Nan.  And the alternating POVs work perfectly in this story.  Abbi Glines knows how to write some hot and dirty scenes and thats exactly what you get in Take A Chance.  Along with the dramatic twists and turns especially near the end and the very alluring characters I could not put this book down.  I absolutely cannot wait for more Grant and Harlow!  Favorite Quote:  I cant fight this.  I dont fucking want to he finished then both his hands landed on each side of my head.  Come with me he whispered and I broke apart into a million pieces.  I screamed his name and bucked underneath him while he chanted things about how tight I was and how good I felt.  ARC provided by Atria in return for an honest review.,5,False
437, . stars!!  I absolutely loved this sweet and sexy romance novel!  The story of how Kate blossoms once she arrives in Napa Valley for her latest assignment had me hooked and I read this fabulous book almost in one sitting.  The chemistry between Kate and Jamie was real and relatable to me and I fell in love with the California and Chicago settings of this story.  Kate is in a hohum relationship with a boyfriend who really doesnt even pay that much attention to her.  and decides to leap at the chance to interview a reclusive tech millionaire at his winery in Napa Valley.  She has learned to rely on only herself which is kind of poignant and sad.  Im all Ive got.  Jamie is one of the winery workers and lets just say he brings Kate out of her shell.  Food is like loveyou know?  Yes I said breathlessly.  We need it to stay alive.  There is so much more to this story and it is a richly written lovely romance that left me wanting more!  There are spoilers to this story and no I didnt see them coming unlike other readers.  I absolutely loved the characters and the story took my breathe away.  Nowhere but Here is a mustread for lovers of a solid story contemporary romance and a swoony leading man!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review,5,False
438, FRENCHED was a deliciously sexy fun and funny romantic story!!  I read this in one day and was literally transported to the City of Light in this wonderfully written and HOT story.  Mia is almost left at the altar her fiancee calls off the wedding a week before by text message and she is completely depressed especially since she is an event planner and used to making detailed wellthoughtout lists for EVERYTHING even down to the outfits she is going to wear each day.  Top Five Reasons Out of  I Am NEVER Coming Out Of This Blanket Fort  Mia is not a spontaneous person at all but ends up traveling alone to Paris on what would have been her honeymoon.  What sounds like it might be a cliche story turns out to be SO much more as she meets a scruffy bartender Lucas who makes a bet with her that leads to them sightseeing together all over the city.  This is a very very funny book and is told from Mias POV.  It is a total escapist story and I absolutely loved every minute of it.  Lucas is smart kind sensitive and not at all like the type of man Mia thought she would be attracted to.  He breaks all the molds but he too has some hangups of his own.  Their chemistry is AMAZING and I wanted more more more!!  This is a standalone book but I will say that I really would like to read more of Lucas and Mias story.  There is also a wonderful supporting cast of characters so maybe we will read more about them in the future?  Hint hint!  This is a perfect sexy little gem of a book.  I highly recommend it.

439, Angie McKeons debut novel is a beautifully written story about terrible loss love and ultimately forgiveness.  This book will draw you right in from the very powerful prologue right through to the very end.  Kylie and Cooper are a young married couple who have suffered an almost unimaginable loss.  Unfortunately their mutual grief almost leads to their complete selfdestruction as a couple.  At first I could not understand why they continued to torture each other but the author writes in such a way that I fell in love with both characters and with their mutual best friend Grayson.  These are not perfect people and they make lots of mistakes along the way.  At a few points I almost could not stand the way Cooper and Kylie treated each other  but then the author gives us flashbacks so you cant help but understand and even sympathize why they are so shattered but yet so joined together  We share a reckless toxic love that feeds the brokenness in me in us.  Our love is an addiction.  A love that I wont ever consider living without.  Against All Odds is an outstanding debut novel from Angie McKeon.  There are plenty of steamy sexy times but also tons of emotion and a really creative story that makes this book stand out from the crowd of contemporary romances.  I have heard that the author has another book in the works and I cant wait to read it!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
440, . stars!!  Kitty Thomas is my goto author for dark erotica so I was excited to read her new release.  Blood Mate is a FAIRY TALE not really an erotic romance in any way and is another intense story from Kitty Thomas.  I dont normally read this genre of books but I absolutely loved the writing and the characters and am so glad I had the opportunity to read this book.  August is a very powerful vampire who is cursed to forever take human victims on order to ensure his own survival.  He was a good man in his former life and he desperately wants to break his curse.  To do this he must find his blood mate a woman whom he cannot enthrall or control via her mind and who will stay with him throughout eternity.  August finds Nicole who is actually very happily married.  Through a series of twists and turns August creates a situation where Nicole will become his blood mate but she doesnt give in so easily and is a very strong and feisty heroine.  August is torn by his actions but he absolutely must ensure his own survival.  Only Kitty Thomas could create a cast of strong characters like those in Blood Lust and an fantastically creative story that will keep you guessing until the very end.  If you want to step outside your usual genre of books I highly recommend this dark and sensual tale.  You will not be disappointed.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
441, . stars!  Therapy is an absolutely beautifully written book that explores very sensitive topics of depression bullying selfharming and addiction in an unflinching way but without ever dragging the reader down or making the situations too unbearable.  Jessica has a tormented life but I was cheering for her and I loved the way the author really got inside this young girls mind.  Jace comes to her rescue but he is certainly no cookiecutter hero and battles demons of his own throughout the book.  The time span of this book is wide and it is a rich story filled with unforgettable characters.  There are some major oh wow moments so Ill keep this review spoilerfree.  Jessica is tormented relentlessly by bullies in high school.  She battles depression and engages in selfharming very graphically depicted and makes some other very poor choices that will come back to haunt her later.  Jace is the quintessential popular high school jock who befriends Jess and their friendship grows into a deep and lasting love.  But nothing is ever easy for Jess so this is not a heartsandflowers love story between her and Jace.  The author writes a wonderfully detailed story and it should be read without knowing the plot spoilers!  This is a mustread book for its sensitivity writing and creativity.  I loved the story and cant wait to read more from Ms.  Perez.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
442, . scorching stars!  As someone who reads a LOT of m/m books I went into TAKE with some reluctance.  I generally prefer male authors of m/m stories and I prefer the books to be graphic.  I have read Ella Franks books and she is a gifted and talented writer but I wasnt sure where shed go with this genre.  Well she totally took me by surprise with Tate and Logan!  I LOVED their story and highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates lots of steam an emotional story and wellwritten engaging characters.  The story is wonderful and my heart broke a little for Tate as he struggled with coming out to his family..  I absolutely loved Logans confident takecharge personality.  He is very comfortable in his own skin.  And the chemistry between these two is unmistakable.  I recommend reading Try first  you can read Take as a standalone but the characters and story are more meaningful if you begin at the beginning.  I did find the main characters to be just a little chatty at some points but Ms.  Frank more than makes up for that with absolutely offthecharts sex scenes that are incredibly erotic.  This demanding m/m reader was more than satisfied.  Have a cold shower ready you will need it after reading Tate and Logans story!  ARC provided by the author for an honest review.,4,False
443, . stars!!  THROTTLE ME is another superhot sexy and delicious book from Chelle Bliss.  Her books always have such a sense of heart and family infused into the smexyness of the story that they truly are a treat to read.  I absolutely loved City  could he be ANY hotter??   and the object of his lust the very endearing schoolteacher Suzy or Suzette City likes to use her real name and not her nickname.  Often I read erotic romance that is rushed empty almost soulless and Throttle Me is the compete opposite: a steamy tattooed hot guy who has had his share of meaningless hookups but who has a real sense of romance love and family.  Tattooed motorcycleriding Alpha bad boy?  Check.  Smart hardworking sweet woman who is just getting her first taste of really mindblowing sex?  Check.  Wellwritten cast of supporting characters?  Check!  Hello Gallo brothers!  There are no billionaires here no young blushing virgin.  What I have always loved about Chelles books are that the characters and everyday working people looking for love and having some superhot sexy times along the way.

444, Devils Game is thrilling sexy and funny and I absolutely devoured every yummy word.  Oh and I love Joannas kickass heroine Em!  This is Book Three in the Reapers MC Series and has little bit different feel than the other books in the series.

445, There is nothing quite like a Tessa Bailey book for a good hot dose of dirtytalking Alpha.

446, BLACK IRIS is a powerful and shockingly different book that kept me up reading all night.  Leah Raeders fierce and descriptive prose is poetic and gripping and pulled at all my emotions.  This is a stunning tale of mental illness love adolescent angst sexuality revenge and finally selfacceptance.  Laney is the voice of the story and she is not the most lovable of characters.  Yes her tale is sad and depressing at first but ultimately it is uplifting in a way that only Leah Raeder can make honest real believable and sympathetic all at once.  Tell me something.  He leaned closer his voice raspy at the edges charred.  If you hate human connection so much why come with us?  Because I dont hate it.  I hate how much I need it.  Because youre the ones I was waiting for.  Because you smell like prey.  Unteachable is one of my favorite books so I could not wait to read BLACK IRIS.  And Leah Raeder has written another powerful and brilliant story that will keep you guessing until the very end.  It is not told in chronological order which adds to the element of disorientation present throughout the book.  Her writing style is beautiful seductive and addicting a world where wet eyelashes become black petals and a lowly puddle of water becomes a brilliant oil color painting.  The characters in this book are unforgettable and I felt as though I personally knew Delaney Blythe Armin Donnie and Hiyam.  The writer is wise beyond her years and her glimpses into married life are brutally honest and painful and will haunt me for a long time to come.  The plot is incredibly imaginative and meaningful and is not all hearts and flowers.  If you are looking for a thrilling suspenseful book with a powerful message and perfect writing then read BLACK IRIS.  It is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is truly a oneofkind story from an author with a very unique voice.  Change isnt peaceful.  Change is violent savage cruel.  ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.,5,False
447, This book is a great read for any fan of Kristen Ashley and lovers of alpha males!  Our hero Jack is a classic alpha male in fact hes the town sheriff and basically falls for Jenn immediately and claims her as his own.  He is very sexy and I loved his nononsense blunt plainspeaking character.  Im not  suit material I wear jeans I hunt bad guys and I rescue damsels in distress.  Jenn has had several major upheavals in her life and ends up relocating to the town of Gunnison in the Colorado mountains.  I liked that our heroine is not  years old but instead is old enough to have a daughter in college.  Much action and drama ensue once Jenn arrive in town and the best part for me was the romance and the very very hot and steamy sex scenes between Jenn and Jack.  There is also a crime/mystery story involved which puts Jenn in peril throughout much of the book.  There is no question that this book is cut from the same mold as Kristen Ashleys stories.  The author clearly and admittedly is a fan of KA.  If you like a growling alpha male with a good heart and a feisty heroine you will love this book.  The story had some editing and grammar issues which troubled me but if the author can tighten those up I am very much looking forward to her next book!  This is a standalone and I loved the ending and prologue.,4,False
448, This book reminded me why I love Aleatha Romig and the Consequences series.  Every event every place every feeling is described with such vivid detail it becomes easy to get lost in her books!  I became immersed back into Tonys world once I started reading BHE.  I have always loved Tony yes I admit it!  so I was anxious to read his POV of certain key events from Consequences.  Sometimes painful but always insightful BHE will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions!  This book is for fans of the Consequences series and is a companion book adding an extra layer of nuance and description to Claire and Tonys story.  You might dislike Tony even more after reading this book but one thing is for sure you will definitely have feelings one way or the other.  I loved this book and cant wait for the next two companion books that the author has planned!  ARC provided the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
449, This was a really good sequel but it was also very fast!  I need Book !  I absolutely love Isis she is incredibly witty sarcastic and fun.  The author has created an amazing female character in this series and I cant wait to read more about her!  Savage Delight begins right where Book  Lovely Vicious ends.  I dont want to give away any spoilers from either Book  or Savage Delight so I will just say that Isis is recovering in the hospital after an attack.  This book then explores Sophia and Jacks past and what a surprise it is!  I loved this book.  The author has a witty fastpaced way of writing and these characters stayed with me after I finished both these books.  I read Savage Delight in one sitting and I cant wait for Book !

450, . stars!!  I absolutely loved this very different Young Adult book from Sara Wolf!  Its a smart funny and very deeply felt story that is completely different and refreshing.  Isis Blake might be one of the feistiest heroines I have ever read and she has really met her match in Jack Hunter.  These two become engaged in a battle of wits and I couldnt wait to see who would back down first  or who would give in.  These two have plenty of very very dark secrets to hide but balancing out the emotional story line is some really funny dialogue and sharp sarcasm.  I absolutely love Sara Wolfs writing style!  The supporting cast of characters are fantastic and all feel vital to the plot.  And I must mention that the cover of the book is gorgeous!  The ending of Lovely Vicious really stunned me and I cant wait for Book  in this series.  Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.,5,False
451, I read this funny very sexy smart and very unique book in one sitting.  The writing style is very different and fresh written mostly in the form of diary entries.  Emma is a smart and ambitious corporate employee and becomes personal assistant to the imposing Alaric Canon who has burned through so many PAs that he is the subject of office betting pools.  The jerky boss/subservient assistant has been done before but never like this!  Emma has a plan to get Alaric to notice her but he is perpetually challenging and sets standards that are basically impossible for his assistants to meet.  Emmas inner monologue is hilarious as she deals with his demanding and dominating personality:  Lifes a bitch and she has several sisters.  This girl has a plan to get Alaric to notice her but her bestlaid plans go wildly awry when the two take a tensionfilled business trip and basically spend / together.  Emma rises to Alarics challenges time after time and I absolutely loved the slow buildup to their incredible sexy times together:  Denim in long expanses.  Barely contours to his thighs.  Thighs I have leaned against but not touched.  Bare feet.  Barefoot!  Put some shoes on already!  How am I supposed to look unaffected and asexual  with all this unfair fuckery happening?  Emma is completely selfdeprecating and really holds no illusions about the possibilities of a relationship with Alaric.  I mean he is rarely seen with the same woman twice.  God Im not in just in the neighborhood of pathetic Im circling the block.  Alaric really grows and develops and begins to show a more human side and I loved that he was not just a onedimensional character.  My heart was literally in my throat by the end of the book.  Qwens writing style is incredibly fresh and unique and is a most welcome addition to the contemporary erotic romance genre.  I adored the conclusion and I am demanding more from this author!

453, I am a big fan of Scott Hidlreths writing style his Baby series is fantastic and I highly recommend the books so I was excited to read Undefeated.  This book is written in a raw takenoprisoners style which is refreshing and different.  This is not the usual damagedheroandheroine story but instead is a real gritty portrayal of two people who have endured suffering and abuse graphically portrayed so be warned but who manage to come together and yes fall in love.  Kace has what can only be described as severe social anxiety disorder and its a miracle she even could hold a conversation with Shane let alone let him love her.  And Shane is surprisingly introspective tender and loving despite his sad background.  Undefeated contains what I thought to be very realistic and detailed fighting scenes which are really written in a different style than the fighter books I have previously read I guess due to the author being male.  The erotica in this book comes a little later in the story but is supersteamy and sexy nonetheless.  If you are looking for a book that is written in a very raw style with very real people then I recommend Undefeated.  And please heed the authors warning about the violence its very very graphic!  And give his Baby series a try you will love them.  ARC provided the author in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
454, LOVE IN ENGLISH is an absolutely magnificent gorgeously written and totally captivating contemporary romance from Karina Halle.  I think that every readers own hopes fears and dreams color their perception of a book and to say that I was blown away by Vera Miles being an astronomy student is a mild understatement.  I was completely fascinated from Page  with our heroine Vera a whipsmart unique insecure beauty who marches to the beat of a different drummer.  Thank you Karina for a heroine whos real flawed emotional and in the end very open to love.  This book transported me to Spain with its sexy and romantic story of Mateo and Vera two mismatched lovers thrown together by chance.  Vera is a young Canadian college student who takes a temporary summer job in Spain to provide Englishonly conversation to Spanish attendees.  Mateo is a handsome married exfootballer wellknown in Europe and older than Vera but quite discontent with his life.  Their love builds slowly beautifully painfully and with tons and tons of offthecharts chemistry.  While in Spain Vera learns to slow down appreciate life and be in the moment.  The scenes between her and Mateo are absolutely breathtaking and almost painfully beautiful.  He sees her inner and outer beauty and in his eyes she is a bright and shining star.  His Estrella.  Design your own universe make your own stars write your own stories and create your own destiny.  This is not a book where the decisions of the hero and heroine are made lightly or without thought to the consequences.  I really felt Mateos agony as he struggled to do the right thing but to also follow his heart and live his life to the fullest.  Love in English is ultimately a beautifully written journey of two very different people who fall madly in love.  If you care about such things this is a standalone book but you will be sad for it to end!  I leave you with my favorite quote from Love in English and the unqualified recommendation that you read this book.  You will love it!  What is love?  In English.  I raised my brows.  Love in English is love...  What is it in Spanish?  I was so enthralled by his hypnotic eyes I could barely remember.  Amore?  He shook his head ever so slightly.  No.  Love in Spanish is you.,5,False
455, This is a SIZZLING hot really well written story that might be one of the steamiest books I have ever read.  I believe that there is a page long sex scene!  Give or take a few pages.  This is part of the Wicked Lovers series but it really can be read as a standalone.  The characters are believable the guys are HOT and the story is incredibly engrossing.  This is one of those books where the title really says it all.  I LOVE menage books and Shayla Black has written one of the most memorable menage stories I have ever read.  With the fantastic D/s elements this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.  Nothing is rushed and I felt an emotional connection with the characters.  I loved everything about this book!  Shayla Black has become one of my goto authors for erotic romance.  I am usually not a fan of suspense elements in my romance books but I loved this story and highly recommend this book.

I absolutely fell in love with Archer he has suffered unimaginable trauma and is closed off from the world.

457, Clipped Wings for me is a somewhat darkish very erotic slowbuilding story that I was very glad I read once I finished.  I absolutely love the tattooed and pierced Hayden and Tenley very much grew on me by the end of this story.  I have not yet read the prequel novella Cupcakes  Ink but I will now run to read it.  I will admit that the first part of this book was a slow burn for me there was no rushing into romance but instead Ms.  Hunting slowly reveals the badly damaged souls of Hayden and Tenley.  But then WOW the author writes some amazingly hot sex scenes which are very much infused with love and caring and an emotional connection between the characters.  Hayden and Tenley both have secrets they are afraid to share with each other even though it becomes clear they are falling in love.  Hayden is seriously hot and really tries to show his vulnerable side to Tenley.  But she is both emotionally and physically scarred and keeps pushing him away.  Everyone has scars Tenley.  If were lucky theyre only on the outside.  Hayden  I ended up falling in love with both these characters by the end and I cant wait for the next book in this series!

458, Wow.  What did I just read?  I am a huge fan of Pepper Winters and Destroyed lived up to every expectation I had plus some.  I did not read any reviews of this book before I started reading it and I am so glad I had no idea about this story other than the synopsis so I will keep this spoilerfree.  Pepper has created two of the most memorable characters I have ever read and even now I cant stop thinking about Hazel and Fox.  This is a dark dark journey but hold out and keep reading because the author makes it worth your while.  Our hero and heroine meet under very harsh circumstances and their story is a raw gritty and emotional journey like no other.  Yes the sex scenes are incredibly steamy but they are infused with a rawness and pain that is at times difficult to witness:  It was the best kiss Id ever received but also the worst.  It sparked lust and need in every inch of me.  My lips wanted more my tongue wanted savagery.  My skin wanted to bruise because he needed to touch me so badly.  All my thoughts disappeared as I nipped at his bottom lip.  He flinched but a second later he copied his sharp canines piercing my oversensitive flesh.  I moaned.  I couldnt take it.  My hands flew up and gripped his shirt.  Yanking him toward me fireworks whizzed in my fingertips my heart galloped toward exploding with lust.  Id never been so drunk on someone before.  Then I landed flat on my back.  The crack of my skull jangled my teeth.  The thick carpet did little to cushion me.  My eyes flared wide and I grunted in pain.  Fear hot and terrible swamped my lust in a dampening wave.  Top rule.  Unbreakable rule.  Dont.  Ever.  Touch.  Me.  Fox kneeled on one knee beside my head breathing hard.  His hand noosed my throat pressing my spine into the carpet.  His eyes were cold and lifeless looking like a hunter intent on blood.   HAZEL  My heart went out to both of them and especially Fox he was a fighter hiding his fractured soul behind a stony murderous facade:  Fox made a sound in the back of his throat tightening his fingers.  He glared looking ready to murder me.  Who are you?  His eyes darted over me as if looking for an answer.  When I didnt respond he swiped his face with his other hand.  His forehead furrowed while his expression turned pissed and stormy.  You think I didnt see you watching?  You had your eyes all over me.  Answer me.  Who the fuck are you?  His deep accented voice stiffened my nipples even as a thrill of fear jolted through me.  My temper gave me false courage.  Im not in the habit of answering such rude questions.   HAZEL  I absolutely loved the dual POVs which are very difficult to do well but Pepper does an amazing job at getting the reader into these characters heads.  Destroyed was an absolute star read for me.  I do hope however that the small editing and grammatical will be corrected.  Otherwise Destroyed is another fantastic and completely original story from the very talented Pepper Winters.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
459, . stars!  Letting Go is a deeply felt elegantly written story of sexual exploration and desire.  Joss is trying to move on with her life after the sudden death if her beloved husband.  Little does she know that his best friend Dash has always been in love with her but never acted on his feelings out of loyalty to his best friend and Joss husband.  Sparks literally fly when she walks into Dashs D/s club one night and he realizes she is looking to be in a submissive relationship.  He is shocked but thrilled at the possibility of a relationship with her.  Maya Banks can write hot and steamy sex scenes like nobodys business!  Wowser!  What was beautiful about the story is that Dash and Joss had a deep connection before they have sex and there is a slow and gradual buildup to their scenes together.  I loved when Joss really saw Dash for the first time as a man and a sexual partner instead of the best friend of her husband.  It was breathtaking.  The sex scenes are totally hot and the anal play scenes are absolutely among the hottest I have ever read!  There is a fabulous Epilogue and no cliffhanger but there will definitely be more books in this series about Joss and Dashs friends.  Cant wait for more from Maya Banks!

460, The Madam is a highly sexually intense and eroticallycharged story of power sex and control.  Is there love?  Yes there is in a way.  The story of Lilith and her rise to become the powerful and influential head of a highclass callgirl operation is tragic at times and always gripping.  Her mother trains her in the ways of the lifestyle and Vivian will certainly not win any Mother of the Year awards.  But she is sure of a womans power and never lets her daughter forget it.  This story spans several decades and is filled with some of the most intense sexual scenes I have ever read.  Menage light BDSM young girls experiencing their first sexual awakenings this book has it all.  All of the characters spanning the years are fascinating and the Miami drug scene in the eighties and nineties provides a dangerous backdrop to the main story.  M. Robinson has an interesting way of writing where she takes you literally through the life and the mind of the main characters.  It is a layered and very rich story and not exactly for the faint of heart.  Ms.  Robinson is extremely talented and certainly can bring on the angst!  Just please note that this book contains some very graphic erotic scenes and if that is your cup of tea then you will love The Madam.

461, This book starts off with an amazingly hot scene between Kat and Ream that doesnt end well.  Ream is explosive and sexy but he is harboring some terrible secrets that cause him to turn off emotionally and push Kat away.  Kat herself is keeping a huge secret from Ream and the book turns on some major misunderstandings between the two of them.  The band is back home after being on tour and Ream aggressively pursues Kat.  She cant deny his largerthanlfe personality and his aggressive alpha tendencies.  I loved this sexy hot rocker but much of the story is spent with Kat denying her true feelings for him.  I absolutely loved the two of them together and they have incredibly explosive chemistry.  The story felt a little rushed toward the end with several plot threads coming together and very crucial characters all appearing at the end of the story.  I love dark reads but the darker elements felt a little forced and I would have loved a little more background on some of the characters that shaped Reams life.  The best parts of the story were when Ream opened up emotionally about his past I really felt connected to him and Kat during those moments in the story.  My heart broke for Ream and what he endured in his past and I loved how he overcame these horrible obstacles so that he could be what Kat needed.  I loved all of the friends and bandmates and look forward to reading about Georgie and Deck.  Nashoda Rose can write seem sizzling hot scenes and I look forward to reading more of her books!

462, This is an actionpacked mafiathemed book with some romance that includes a hint of a classic love triangle.  The story is told from multiple POVs which can be a little disorienting but which does give insight into the three main guy characters.  I loved the chemistry between Nixon and Trace but I needed more romance!  Their scenes together were sizzling but not explicit.  This book explores the inner workings of mafia families and if you like mob stories then you will love that part of the plot.  There are a lot of secondary characters here as well as lots of betrayals and violence...in short a good look into the uncertain and tough world of crime families.  I am interested to see where Chases story goes and hope there will be more written about him!  I loved his scenes with Trace.  Rachel Van Dyken is an excellent writer and there is never a dull moment with this story.  Overall I thought a Elect was a fastpaced read with welldeveloped characters and lots of surprising plot twists.  ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review,4,False

464, First be aware that this book is not for the faint of heart.  Human trafficking drugs kidnapping abuse in all forms  this story contains all of this and more.  But it is also an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling book if you can make it through the very difficult parts of Tess and Qs story.  Reading the fantastic Tears of Tess first is a must so that you can fully understand the dark and complex nature of the main characters relationship.  I had been waiting for Pepper Winers to continue Tess and Qs story and I devoured Quintessentially Q almost in one sitting.  This is a highly addictive series and the writing is lush detailed and very very sexy.  I mean Q almost literally burns up the pages.  If you like very dark erotic romance yes this is most definitely a romantic story then I cant recommend this book and series highly enough.  One of my favorite books this year.

465, Perfect!  The publisher very graciously sent me a copy of this gorgeous book to review.  From the minute I opened this book I remembered why I LOVE Travis Maddox so much.  This story brought me back to those treasured times when I would get lost in a book!  A Beautiful Wedding answers all the questions you might have about the circumstances surrounding Travis and Abbys wedding.  It is funny it is tender it is swoonworthy and yes I cried several times during the story!  Jamie McGuire is such a great writer that I immediately reconnected with these characters and was drawn right back into their story.  This novella can definitely be read in one sitting but I kind of wanted to draw it out because I love Travis so much.  This fantastic story is a mustread for all fans of the Beautiful Disaster series!  Favorite lines:  We only got one shot at a wedding night and I wanted it to be perfect.  A Maddox boy will take you all the way to the edge but if you go with him hell follow you anywhere.  If youre not with me its not where I want to be.

466, I absolutely love Laurelin Paiges writing style and Forever With You does not disappoint.  The story begins right after Found in You ends and launches right into more delicious romance and intense chemistry between Alayna and Hudson.  I loved this attentive and romantic side of Hudson!  No.  This is better than a beginning.  This is what happens next.   Hudson  There are still lots of external forces conspiring to drive a wedge between these new lovers relationship.  PLus Alayna has her own demons to deal with which make her behaviour at times vert maddening!  This book inspired a lot of emotion in me and I was really worried that she would be the one to drive the two of them apart:  Hed told me once that he would always be manioulative and domineering even when he wasnt playing games.  It was who he was.  Me I would always be obssessive.  Id always question.  Even when I was healthy.  Asking to forget about this was defying my nature.   Alayna  Hudson does all that he can possibly do under the circumstances to persuade Laynie that his feelings for her are genuine and real.  But her obsessive nature bubbles to the surface on more than one occassion.  Hudson also seems to be keeping something from Laynie despite their promises to be completely honest and open with each other.  There is a very compelling storyline here that is very creative and emotional.  At times I feared that Hudsons behavior not Laynies would destroy their relationship.  I dont want to give any spoilers away but rest assured that this book is packed with some totally HOT sex scenes and a fantastic storyline.  It is a fabulous conclusion to the series!  I highyl recommend this yummy trilogy and I hope there will be more written about these characters in the future.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
467, Ill admit it.  Even though I am addicted to reading sometimes I get a little jaded...And then a book like Tangled comes along and BAM!  Just like that Im addicted to reading again.  Seriously a book that cites Braveheart the Borg an NYU sex study and frogs?  Im in.  Tangled is one of the most original books I have ever read.  Told from the main male character Drews POV the very talented author gives the reader a peek into how guys really feel and think:  Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy.  A fatty.  Morning wood.  Im sure theres some medical explanation for the phenomenon but I just like to think of it as a little present from God.  Drew is insanely attractive smart hardworking and very wealthy.  Sounds cliche right?  In the hands of this talented author Drew is one of the most memorable and original characters I have ever encountered!  I love Drews inner monologues.  They are both hysterically funny and very very touching.  Hes a selfconfessed womanizer who meets his match in the very smart and gorgeous Kate Brooks.  He falls hard for Kate and all his old rules about women and dating fly out the window.  Women fall in love quicker than men.  Easier and more often.  But when guys fall?  We go down harder.  And when things go bad?  When its not us who ends it?  We dont get to walk away.  We crawl.   The author has described the genre of Tangled as Comedic Erotica and Funny Smut.  Both phrases describe this book to a tee.  It is both hilarious and very very intense.  I started reading this book past midnight and did not want to put it down.  Seriously its that addictive.  Dont waste time reading this review.  Start reading Tangled.  You will absolutely fall in love with Drew!  ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.,5,False
468, The Hard Ink Series by Laura Kaye is a thrilling and supersexy series!  I loved the first book As Hard As It Get and Hard As You Can delivers another romantic suspense story with Shane and Crystal.  Their story begins almost immediately after the first book.  They both have suffered terribly in different ways.  Crystal is a waitress at a strip club paying off an old debt while taking care of her special needs sister.  Shane is a protective former Special Forces Officer who is intrigued by Crystal and wants nothing more than to take care of her.  These two are dealing with some very tough circumstances to put it mildly.  There is a pretty detailed backstory in Hard As It Gets that might be helpful to read before Shane and Crystals book to give you a sense of the characters and their relationship to each other.  I absolutely loved the sexy scenes between Shane and Crystal and the twists and turns that Laura Kaye does so well.  If you like super hot military men and a steamy story with some mystery and intrigue thrown in than Hard As You Can is for you!  ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review,4,False

470,  stars!  I love to read and I read a ton of books.  Among all the books I have read Night Owl is one of my top favorite books of all time.  I could not wait to get my hands on Last Light.  And let me just say that M. Pierce delivered bigtime with this book.  Matt Sky makes my heart hurt.  I have not stopped thinking about him since I finished reading Last Light.  Wait what?  Hes a fictional character?  Thats okay.  Im still obsessed with him.  Last Light picks up as Matt has faked his own death and retreated to a life of solitude in the woods.  He simply cannot bear the attention and acclaim that came with being a famous author.  He has convinced Hannah to play along with his ruse much to her growing dismay.  Poor beleagured Hannah is forced into the charade as she attends Matts memorial and is faced with lying to his family and an evergrowing web of deceit.  And hello Sky brothers!  In Last Light we get to know ubersexy badboy Seth who I hope and pray will get his own story soon.  Seth is absolutely irresistable.  But I digress.  Matt made me very uncomfortable with his growing deception and his relationship with a new character named Melanie.  If she was supposed to be a sympathetic character Im not buying it.  I hated her!  I dont want to give away any plot spoilers so I will just say that I am in love with this series and with this author.  The sense of melancholy that pervades this book is completely haunting but is perfectly balanced with humor and some of the hottest sex scenes you will EVER read.  Did I mention that M. Pierce is a brilliant writer?  I havent stopped thinking about this book since I finished and I might have to go back in for a reread.  The cast of characters from this series are unforgettable.  I cannot wait for After Dark!  ARC reviewed from NetGalley,5,False
471, . stars!!  Hard As It Gets not only hooked me in from the first page it actually had me at the cover.  Whoa!  The publisher was kind enough to send me a paperback and it is stunning.  Now on to the novel.  I absolutely loved this very suspenseful and totally HOT story of Becca and Nick and the introduction into the Hard Ink world.  Becca is frantically searching for her missing brother and her search leads her to Nicholas Bixey and Hard Ink the tattoo parlor he coowns with his brother.  Nick resists her at first but then is drawn into helping her due to the deep ties he had with her military father and because he is completely attracted to her.  The action begins and doesnt let up until the last page.  There are some loose ends left NOT a cliffhanger though!  and I cant wait to see where the author takes us with the underlying mystery.  One of the reasons why I loved this romantic suspense story is because the relationship between Becca and Nick builds nicely and is very believable.  Yes their chemistry is off the charts but they both treat each other with respect and Becca could have been a pushover but shes actually a very strong character.  Hard As It Gets is a tough sexy actionfilled mystery filled with wellwritten fantastic characters.  Im eager to read more about each and every one.  Nick is one hot Alpha male and I loved the VERY steamy sexy times between Nick and Becca.  Wowza!  Ms.  Kaye really knows how to turn up the heat!  This was my very first Laura Kaye novel and Im hooked!  Im looking forward to reading more books in this series.  ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review,5,False
472, A lush sensual erotic and suspenseful story that is at once poignant and dangerous.  Another mustread from.SR and easily one of my top reads of !  To say that I was ecstatic to read this book is an understatement.  The Raven has everything I love about Sylvain Reynards writing and more.  Lyrical erotic sensual and mysterious The Raven begins another addictive series with the introduction of Raven and the Prince.  This book is a mustread!  Professor Emerson and his wife do appear here but Raven and the Prince are themselves insanely fascinating.  Even if you are not a huge fan of paranormal stories this book is a must read for the thrilling story and lush intensely sexual scenes.  We are introduced to the Prince leader of the City of Florence who is at once cold and calculating but beautiful in his own right.  He cannot stay away from Raven and feels compelled to help her again and again.  He sees in her virtue and goodness and she awakens longdormant feelings that he never believed he could have even at his own peril.  Im afraid that trouble is not what you do.  Trouble is what you are.  Raven is an unlikely heroine and I fell in love with her!  She is damaged goods inside and out and her painful history is hinted at and then ultimately explained.  She is an extremely sympathetic character and I cannot wait to read more about her in the next book.  The Prince too is surprised at his attraction to her might she lead him to redemption and true love?  In many ways we are the most perfect match.  We see each other as we are but neither of us views the other as broken.  I am not articulate enough to adequately describe the virtues of this book!  Part art history lesson part paranormal romance part erotica it is a must read for all fans of Gabriels Inferno  and even for those readers new to the series.  This book can be read as a standalone but is best understood after having read the GI series.  The Raven is engrossing suspenseful sexy and and yes humorous.  Do not miss this book!  And while it has a a fabulous conclusion there is much much more to come for these characters and I cannot wait for more!  Favorite quote:  You are my greatest virtue and my deepest vice.,5,False
473, This book drew me in right from the first few pages.  Lorrie has been understandably struggling with the tragic deaths of both parents.  She has returned to college after taking time off and feels overwhelmed by her life.  She is almost literally thrown right into the arms of the incredibly hot Hunter The Hammer Jensen a fellow college student who also happens to be a sexy MMA fighter.  Lorrie finally feels a little emotion but refuses to let herself become romantically involved with Hunter.  I really loved Hunter.  He is sexy incredibly sweet to Lorrie and doesnt give up when Lorrie tries to keep him at arms length.  Theres a slow build up to their relationship but when they get together BAM!  The floodgates really open up so to speak!  The author really knows how to write incredibly steamy sex scenes and Hunter and Lorrie are totally HOT together.  There were parts of this story that I became frustrated with Lorrie.  I mean this gorgeous and really caring guy wanted to be more than friends but she kept pushing him away.  It then becomes clear that Hunter also has a wounded soul and is maybe hiding a secret or two of his own.  I really enjoyed this book.  What started off as a typical college story turned into something more for me.  I liked the creative plot and the emotion between Lorrie and Hunter.  This book ends on a very suprising note and I cant wait to read more of Lorrie and Hunters story!  Copy provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
474, Saving Alexander is a very sexy very raw and very emotional m/m love story with a thriller thrown in for good measure.  As a fan of the m/m genre I found the story to be very gripping and very satisfying in terms of the heat factor.  I read a fair amount of m/m books and I generally find female authors to be a bit less gritty but I will say the sex scenes in Saving Alexander did not disappoint!  The heartbreaking description of Alexs background from which he tries to find some sort of healing through BDSM sessions is balanced out nicely by the loving relationship he finds with Sage.  There is a suspenseful storyline here along with the very erotic romance between Sage and Alex.  The only minor drawback for me was that these two talked A LOT about their relationship and their feelings.  But overall I really liked this book and found it to be incredibly well written and enjoyable!  Definitely a mustread for any fan of m/m books.

475, First let me be a little superficial and say that I have always loved this book cover and now after reading Eversea I can say that everything on the cover has significance from the colors to the shapes to the objects.  I love it when that much thought goes into a cover.  Okay now onto the story.  I read this fantastic book in one day!  Jack and Keri Ann totally drew me in and would not let go.  I absolutely loved the Southern beach town setting and the notsopretty glimpse into the world of Hollywood fame and superstardom.  The author has created very passionate and complex characters that I related to from the first page.  And the steam factor is perfect!  Both characters have complicated histories that are slowly revealed making for an emotional and at times shocking read.  Book Hangover factor was a  on this one.  Loved this book and cannot wait for its sequel Forever Jack.,5,False
476, There are a lot of books competing for your attention but The Dark Light of Day is a mustread!  Gritty sexy rough heartbreaking but uplifting and yes romantic Abby and Jake will get under your skin and you wont soon forget them.  Abby has had a hardknock life and is beaten down at every turn.  Jake is sexy and dangerous but theres a lot more to him than meets the eye.

I adore this author and cant wait for her next book King.  Photo courtesy of the author,5,False
477, . stars!!  Fantastic story with depth steam and heart.  I picked up Jake Undone and was immediately drawn into the story without knowing too much about the author or the characters.  I recommend reading Gemini first but I dont think its  necessary.  Jake and Nina captivated me from the the first page.  They begin in the friend zone as roommates but its clear there is so much more to Jake than he is revealing to Nina.  He is hot tatted passionate and surprise an engineer!  Nina is beautiful but filled with phobias which Jake helps her overcome.  These two have amazing chemistry and the story is totally captivating!  This book was a complete surprise.  Jake and Ninas sexy times are absolutely incredible.  The story has two major plot twists yes two!  which completely took me by surprise.  The author has created a very memorable book boyfriend in Jake.  And the dual POVs are perfect.  I am so happy to have found Jake Nina and author Penelope Ward and look forward to her next book!,4,False
478,  / stars!  A very grownup sequel to the first book in this series Disclosure of the Heart is a wonderful story about secondchance love.  Nicki works in the White House traveling with the President and in a seemingly passionate relationship with Juan Carlos.  Along comes Adam now a BBC reporter who now has a longterm girlfriend.  Nicki cant forget her first love Adam but a relationship between them now would violate lots of rules both personal and professional.  There is lots of backandforth between Adam and Nicki and although at times I wanted their relationship to speed up a bit it was actually very realistic.  I was pleasantly surprised at the steam factor in this book!  I loved it!  Mary Whitney obviously did her research here on the politics of working in the White House.  This is a very smart sexy adult book and is a great conclusion to Adam and Nickis story!  An ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review,4,False

481,  stars!!  If I could give this book  stars I would.  Fighting Redemption belongs on everyones mustread list.  The writing is perfection the story is emotional sexy funny beautiful and thrilling and the characters will stay with you long after you finish the words on the page.  Kate McCarthy has created a memorable novel that is filled with so much emotion loyalty and love that I dont even know how I can do justice to her written words.  I absolutely fell in love with Jake Ryan and Fin and was rooting for all of them from the first page!  Ryan had very painful childhood and grows up desperate to leave his small town far behind.  He has a burning desire to join the military and no one not even the beautiful and sweet Fin can change his course.  He loves her deeply but feels that he must let her move on with her life because the military will always come first for him.  He shouldnt still be feeling this way after so many years.  Why was he doing this to her and to himself?  It was better for everyone if he stayed away like he was supposed to.  Fin too tries to move on but is drawn to Ryan and cant let go.  She took a step closer and he breathed her in her scent like jasmine on a hot summers day.  He was surprised when he looked into her eyes and saw anger burning hotly in their depths.  The book perfectly outlines their struggles to love overcome loss and be real and honest with one another.  Why cant I force myself to leave?  He rested his forehead against hers and closed his eyes.  I hurt too.  For six years I fought every day not to think of you and I lost because every day you were all I could see.  You were the best thing in my lifeso sweet and innocent and so goddamn tempting.  His hand strayed from her hip and slid down to grip her ass.  He swallowed the groan.  I stayed away so you could move on.  This is easily one of my top books of  and it is a mustread!!  Fighting Redemption is the perfect mix of Alpha heroes emotion sexy times a great story and extremely wellwritten characters.

And I heard that she is writing a bonus chapter to Fighting Redemption so stay tuned!,5,False

483, . stars!!  Always You is a very hot sweet and sometimes angsty story of a studentteacher romance.  Wrenn is very mature for an  year old and Dalton is only a few years older just out of college.  Added to that is the fact that he is teaching at her school on a temporary assignment filling in for a teacher on maternity leave.  Their attraction builds and their scenes together are very satisfying and supersteamy.  This story is perfect for when you need a sexy fairly quick read that is a standalone with no cliffhanger.  I didnt feel too much of a taboo feeling towards their relationship but I was on pins and needles waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Dalton is hiding a lifechanging secret that is hinted at from the beginning.  I liked the sensitivity with which the author dealt with his topic and the ending and prologue were nicely satisfying.  Always You is another enjoyable sexy and emotional read from Missy Johnson.,4,False
484, . stars!  LOVE LOVE LOVED it!  Jace and Colt love the name have been admiring each other from afar for years.  Jace is openly gay but Colt is closeted.  This book literally hits the ground running and doesnt let up until the end.  I was hooked right away and loved every minute of this very beautiful sexy and dramatic story.  And let me tell you this story is HOT!  When Colt and Jace first get together there are almost fireworks exploding!  Let me tell you what I am sure of what I want.  I want you to fuck me tonight.  I want you inside me.  Its my first time but I know I liked your finger in my ass when we made out in the locker room.  How do you feel about that?  I loved Jace he is kind and loving and only wants the best for Colt.  He could have pushed Colt to come out of the closet but he didnt.  He is loving and protective even though he gets hurt by Colts actions.  These characters tragically spend years apart and during that time I also felt huge sympathy for Colt.  Living his life as a lie brings him nothing but pain and heartache.  But he courageously makes a lot of changes and as part of that he goes after the love of his life Jace.  No I just need a minute thats all.  Ive thought about this night for a long time.  I want this and I want it with you.  Colt kissed Jaces lips a smile spread across his face.  I plan on doing this often.  Just be gentle with me or not.  Whatever.  And with that Colt gave a devilish smirk winked and turned on his heel not bothering to look back as he stepped inside the bathroom.  I loved the beautiful love story between Jace and Colt.  It gets a but melodramatic at times but the love scenes are fantastic and I loved the whole storyline about being openly gay in the world of professional sports.  I love a sexy M/M story with two male leads who are devoted to each other.  Beware this book is also filled with some pretty hateful characters!  There are also some great supporting players.  In particular I am hopeful that Mitch will get his own story!  This is my first book by Kindle Alexander and I cant wait to read more from her.

There is a little bit of a Colleen Hoover and Jamie McGuire vibe about this book but it is also very adult on many levels despite the college setting.  Amber Brock and Ryder are all very complex characters and their histories makes it easy to understand and empathize with them as they plunge headlong into a steamy and passionate relationship.  Amber especially has suffered terribly but has pulled her life together somewhat by attending college in Maryland.  ... Their safety net came too late unable to save me from my ancient habits.  I continue to disconnect selfdestructing one man at a time using sex as a brain detox.  Sex is and will always be where I find control a hidden shelter keeping me benign from the cancer that will forever disease the dark frayed edges of my thoughts.  Starting at the age of fourteen Ive abused loved craved and hated sex in ways most people cant fathom.  Itd rock their skulls.  Ive given it away without feeling a morsel of anything for the person on the receiving end and many times accepted it from those I knew couldnt stomach me.  Amber is deeply attracted to both Brock and Ryder but Gail McHugh makes it very understandable how their feelings develop even though Brock and Ryder are best friends:  Despite my friendship with Brock Ambers worth a few rounds in the moral boxing ring.  The plot was unexpectedly thrilling and there was a rawness to this book that I did not expect.  The characters were also unexpectedly sympathetic.  I had a few minor drawbacks with the story but overall I felt that Amber to Ashes was a very fresh and surprisingly sexy story that left me wanting more from this author!  Attraction.  Lust.  All a lethal but beautiful cocktail thats about to combust exploding each of us into a state of numbness a state of healing through what we need.  Each other .

486, Oh.  My.  God.  What took me so long to read these books?  LOVE this series!  Remember When  takes place almost a decade after high school and everyone has gone their own way.  Layla is a journalist and finds herself in a position to interview Trip who has gone on to become a major Hollywood star.  She has never forgotten Trip but assumes he has moved on with his life.  In fact she is engaged to a seemingly perfect guy.  Trip Wilmington had been a gorgeous teenaged boy no question.  But Trip Wiley was a gorgeous young man exuding raw unabashed sex at every turn.  Even though so much time has passed Trip and Layla pick up their easy friendship right away.  They have a lot of shared history together and Trip feels comfortable in Laylas presence.  Their undeniable physical attraction is there too but will it be enough for both of them to face the truth about their feelings for each other?  The author kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading this book.  Would Layla and Trip get a chance to correct their past actions?  This is an absolutely amazing witty and emotional book and I dont want to give away any of the spectacular plot here.  Suffice it to say my heart stopped a few times while reading and I am not sure I can recover from the serious book hangover!  This series has become one of my alltime favorites.

487, Can you ever recapture the thrill of your first love?  T. Torrest has gifted us readers with a nostalgic sweet sexy and emotional story about two high schoolers trying to navigate the treacherous waters of first love.  More than anything Trip and Layla are great friends but both are too young and perhaps inexperienced to move things forward in the romance department.  Trip has become one of my favorite book boyfriends.  He is sweet gorgeous a little insecure and a little damaged.  I absolutely devoured this nostalgic story about smalltown life and loved all the swoonworthy moments in this book.  Trip is the new kid in school and Layla quickly befriends him.  But she falls for him and isnt sure of his feelings for her.  The story takes place during senior year of high school so everyone is getting ready to go their own way which adds to the overall poignant atmosphere of the story.  Remember When is a rich funny witty and beautiful look back at the feelings of our first true love.  It is fast paced and filled with memorable characters.  The final chapters of this book might contain one of my favorite scenes ever in a book.  I am still thinking about it.  I cant properly explain all the feelings that the author evoked in me while reading this book but thank goodness I could start Book  immediately after finishing!  I did not want to leave Trip and Layla and you wont either.  One of my top books so far this year.,5,False

489, . stars!!  The Bellas joint review:  Cathy: I really liked this story about Jackson and Serenity!  I felt sympathy for Serenity because of the situation she was forced into by Hogan at the same time I was mad at her for doing what she was to the MC.  I really loved Jackson.  Hes kind and helpful underneath the rough exterior.  He really wants to help Serenity sort her shit out.  It doesnt  hurt that that he is hot as hell and the sex is great.  Knights Sinner is a great quick read.  Ellen: Once again Bella delivers a superhot sexy story with characters you can sympathize with.  I loved Serenity and the chemistry between Jackson and her is amazing.  There are some supersteamy scenes between them I loved Jackson because he is a little older and really knows what he wants.  The age difference between Jackson and Serenity keeps things interesting.  The story has just enough tension and drama to keep this a pageturner there is some violence but the sex is HOT HOT HOT.  And although I am sad that this is the last book in this series Muff will be getting a novella!  I can only hope it will be as hot as the MC Sinners books!,4,False
490, Calling all romance junkies Torn is for you!  This book wraps up the incredibly sexy complicated and intense story between River Dahlia and Ben that began in Connected.  I could not imagine where these characters story would end up after the shocker at the end of Connected but Ms.  Karr has given us an incredibly satisfying conclusion along with a ton of emotion sex angst betrayal and plot twists!  Dahlia and Rivers relationship is threatened by the shocking reappearance of Ben...River is jealous and angry...Dahlia is confused and insecure in her relationship with River...and Ben wants Dahlia back.  River and Dahlia have a seemingly loving and beautiful relationship but will their devotion to each other survive all the obstacles thrown in their path?  Although I felt a little sorry for Ben throughout the story I was thrilled at the conclusion to these characters stories and completely shocked by the very surprising revelations about several main characters near the end of the story.  There is lots of romance and sex in Torn to balance out all the emotion and drama!  I really love the authors writing style.  Plus I was thrilled to learn that there will be more books in this series about characters from Connected and Torn.  Im definitely looking forward to reading their stories!,4,False
491, This was the first book I have read by this author and although this is the third book in a series you can definitely read this book as a standalone.  I loved Adam and Mia.  He is a toughtalking Alpha cop and she is a beautiful redhead who doesnt take BS from anyone.  I loved Adam and Mias nearconstant fighting almost as much as I loved their incredibly hot sex scenes.  These two cant stay away from each other even though they drive each other crazy when theyre together.  The book is told in a series of alternating POVs which I loved.  Adam and Mia married young and suffered through an incredibly painful tragedy.  A series of unfortunate misunderstandings leads to their breaking up but they never stopped loving each other.  At times during the story I found Mias behavior to be absolutely infuriating but I really grew to love her about halfway through the book!  And Adam is amazing!  All he wants to do is provide a home for Mia.  He is a really good guy but he always says the wrong thing.  There is an exciting storyline and a very satisfying epilogue to Adam and Mias story.  Sometimes you need a break from all the wealthy billionaire/innocent heroine love stories with a story about two very downtoearth and relatable characters and this is the perfect antidote.  I am going to read the first two books in this series and I am looking forward to more stories from this author!  An ARC was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
492, Her is a sweet romantic story with just the right amount of steam.  I love alternate POVs and the author does a great job in giving us Wills version of his and Sarahs story.  The male POV and the sexy scenes keep this story from being too sweet or sentimental.  Carey Heywood is a very talented writer and really brings these characters to life.  Will is totally swoonworthy and is fantastic book boyfriend material!  He is sooo romantic!  Overall a lovely romantic story with some hot scenes and just the right touch of emotion!,4,False
493, My first thoughts when I finished were WTF did I just read??  Speechless.  Amazing story!!  I loved this book.  It drew me in kept me enthralled until the end and made me fall in love with Twitch.  I cared about the characters and loved the supporting cast as well.  The author is incredibly inventive and I found the plot to be very exciting and the sex thrilling.  Did I mention that I absolutely love Twitch?

494, . stars loved it!  Surprisingly funny thrilling and sexy.  Do not shy away from Good because of the studentteacher storyline!  This book is filled with plenty of funny and witty moments to go along with the dramatic emotional and very sexy scenes.  The book is an emotional rollercoaster but the author wisely lightens up the drama with just enough lighthearted moments to make this one very enjoyable and readinonesitting book.  Cadence is a high school student who made one pretty bad mistake one night.  She is sent to juvenile detention and when she returns to high school she is horribly bullied and becomes a total outcast.  Her parents are in complete denial about her situation at school adding to her desperation and loneliness.  The only bright spot well two more about that in a minute is her smart kind and ohsosexy teacher Mark Connelly.  He recognizes the torture Cadence is suffering through at school and befriends her.  He finds her beautiful funny smart and sensitive beneath the toughgirl attitude she tries to adopt at school.  The other bright spot in Cadences life and in the book is her friend Avery a sarcastic funny and very smart girl who helps Cadence through some of her toughest moments.  I loved Avery!  And the teenagegirl banter between Cadence and Avery is hilarious sad dirty and sweet all at the same time.  Back to Mr.  Connelly.  I loved him.  The forbidden aspect of their relationship only made it more thrilling and poignant for me.  Adding to the age difference Cadence comes from a strict Christian home and she constantly battles with what she has been taught.  Is she a bad person?  No.  Is Mark a bad person?  Absolutely not!  I absolutely loved both characters loved reading about their internal struggles and loved their beautiful and tender love scenes together.

495, . stars!  Man of My Dreams is a sweet emotional sexy and beautiful story!  This book has a lot of heart.  Faith Andrews drew me me into Mias story from the very beginning grabbed my heart and didnt let go until the last page.  To call this a secondchance love story doesnt really do this wonderful book justice.  Mia and Declan married very young had children right away and got caught up in the same problems many married couples face: he works very long hours she feels underappreciated and unattractive he is a little resentful their young children demand a lot of energy and attention etc.  etc.  Declan is a gorgeous sensitive smart and loving husband but Mia always dreams about the whatifs with her high school crush Noah.  Is the grass always greener on the other side?  You will have to read Man of My Dreams to find out.  There are no bad people in this book!  Mia Declan and Noah are all good loving characters who find themselves a little weighed down by the ordinary problems of life.  The author has written some wonderful characters here and I absolutely loved both Declan and Noah.  I was thrilled at the conclusion of this book.  I dont want to give any spoilers away because the author really kept me breathlessly guessing up until the very end where this story would go!  Man of My Dreams is a very wellwritten touching and fast paced debut story and I am looking forward to more books from Ms.  Andrews!

496, Beat of the Heart is Book Two in the Runaway Train series and is a hot sweet entertaining and romantic book.  AJ is the Latino drummer that we met in Book One.  The ladies fall all over him but he is searching for something more meaningful.  A chance meeting with nurse Mia might be just the cure for him.  We are treated to lots of hot sexy times with AJ and Mia but will she let down her guard and let him in to her heart?  Mia is introduced to AJs rock musician lifestyle and wonders if she can deal with his crazy lifestyle even though she really does begin to develop deep feelings for him.  I love books with a dual POV so this was a big plus for me.  I also liked the fact that Mia is pretty much an average working woman and yet AJ sees her as beautiful desirable and sexy.  Beat of the Heart is a fairly light erotic and well written book.  Ms.  Ashleys writing style flows well and I cared about the characters.  If you want a break from a heavy angsty book then Beat of the Heart is for you.  Enjoy!  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
497, I read Freeing Asia and am a big fan of E.M.  Abels writing.  She writes real new adult characters who are not perfect by any means and who are all looking to find themselves a little bit.  There are connected characters in Breaking Shaun but you absolutely can read this book without having read Freeing Asia although I totally recommend it because its awesome Breaking Shaun tells the story of Natalie and Shaun Asias brother.  He is a hot and sexy gorgeous surfer a total manwhore who is unapologetic in his behavior but in his defense completely honest and open with the girls that he sleeps with.  Full disclosure.  but it doesnt make for any less drama on the part of the girls he leaves behind.  He is NOT interested in any kind of lasting relationship at all.  Shaun then meets his match in the smart and sexy Natalie.  She has moved to town to get a fresh start and starts work as a bartender.  She too doesnt believe in true love and uses guys for sex.  Perfect match for Shaun right?  Natalie has her reasons for this behavior which we find out later in the story.  Shaun and Natalies group of friends like to party so there is lots and lots of wild nights out drinking and smoking pot.  Shaun and Natalie start off as good friends and move towards a deeper relationship when they have the most mindblowing sex of their lives.  And Ms.  Abel can write some SOMKING hot sex scenes!  What I loved about the sexy times is that they are actually infused with some pretty deep feelings despite what Shaun and Natalie might say about wanting to remain unattached.  As Natalie asserts:  Women like me dont fall for men like you.  We dont come when you call we dont beg for your attention and we dont confuse sex with love.  Women like me break men like you  Natalie and Shaun really do build a solid caring friendship and they both try to make the other a better person.  Natalie encourages Shaun to move forward with this surfboard designs and Shaun encourages her to return to school to pursue her passion photography.  I absolutely love the beachy setting of Breaking Shaun and the glimpses into the world of surfing.  This is another warm very sexy wellwritten story with lots of heart.  There is lots of partying but there is also a great story and strong characters.  I love this author and hope there will be more books in this series!

498,  / stars!!  Freeing Asia was one of those books that started off in one place and then completely changed course and took me in a whole other direction.  This was a completely refreshing and surprising book that is a total gem and a wonderful read.  Its hard to believe this is the first book by this author.  Asia grew up the only girl in a house full of boys an artist who is afraid to explore her talent and be herself.  While living her somewhat lonely life she meets the gorgeous sexy and wealthy Jay which is where I thought Uh oh not this story line again.  Well I was dead wrong!  Freeing Asia is about so much more it is about being yourself not being afraid to love and not changing to be what other people want you to be.  Jay is driven smart handsome very kind and clearly smitten with Asia.  And she with him:  He had the power to change me and turn me into anything he wanted me to be.  And in this moment I was willing to be whatever he wanted.  Asia had her heart broken by her first love Marcus who is still in her life as her brothers best friend.  The author writes so many smexy scenes between Jay and Asia that I was really caught offguard by where this story went.  Marcus had been my first.  Hed known the real me and there had been something between us that I could never explain.  I dont want to go into much detail about the plot because it is very creative and filled with a fabulous cast of supporting characters.  Freeing Asia is a great story about finding yourself and finding your own selfworth.  You should be proud of who you are babe cause you are amazing.  Dont worry theres lots and lots of steam in this book!  This is the kind of book that you start reading and dont put down until youre finished.  I absolutely felt a deep connection to these characters and must admit that it was tough to pick between Marcus and Jay!  But ultimately this is a book about learning to love yourself before you can let others love you.  And for that the author should be applauded.  I LOVED all the characters in Freeing Asia and cant wait for the next book from Ms.  Abel!,4,False
499, Sometimes a book comes along that grabs you from the first page and doesnt let you go.  Making faces is one of those books.  Perfectly written emotional and tragic but funny and beautiful all at once.  Just like life.  Amy Harmon has a gift for storytelling and character development and has created a book that will stay with you long after you finish.  This book is a mustread your life will be all the richer for reading it.  Fern has been the plain girl for most of her life the quiet kind of girl who fades into the background.  She has an incredibly close bond with her cousin and with him and Ambrose form the heart of this story.  Fern Ambrose and Bailey all attended high school together and Fern loved Amborse from afar.  Ambrose was the star wrestler and had his pick of the prettiest girls.  The way Amy Harmon writes about high school was incredibly funny and painful at the same time.  But then after graduation Ambrose leaves for Iraq and returns a very changed man.  Sometimes you cant take your life back.  Sometimes its dead and buried and you can only make a new life.  Ambrose didnt know what that life would look like.  For the first time he really gets to know Fern and sees her true inner beauty.  But Fern is still incredibly insecure about her outward appearance and is desperate to have Ambrose really desire her as a beautiful woman.  But I would really like it if for once I could be beautiful on the outside.  The journey these characters take is unforgettable.  Do not miss Making Faces.  Amy Harmons incredible story is ultimately uplifting beautiful and hopeful.  Do not miss this book!,5,False
500, . stars!!  More Than Her is a suprisingly engaging fastpaced and very emotional story!  I was immediately drawn into Logan and Amandas story and read this juicy story almost in one sitting.  Logan is somewhat of a jerk the word asshole is used over  times in this book!  but to me he really is a good guy way down deep inside.  He has his reasons for acting the way he does.  Will Amanda be able to finally reach the real Logan?  I absolutely loved the nearconstant giveandtake between these two and also loved their superhot chemistry.  This book had some totally surprising twistsandturns and I devoured every page!  ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
501, HO.  LEE.  SHIT.  I feel sorry for all the girls in the world that never get to experience a Jake Andrews at least once in their lifetime.   Mikayla  So do I!  What started off for me as a classic Young Adult book became much much more!  Jake Andrews where have you been all my life?  This story is both very sweet and very very hot which I love.  Mikayla is not only faced with heartbreak very early on in this story but she is also faced with an unspeakable tragedy.  To the rescue comes the hot Jake Andrews who is actually a really really great guy underneath all that baseballplaying hotness.  And hes funny too.  Mikayla has moments of humor too which totally works to lighten up the darker parts of this story.  Jake and Mikayla have some very explicit sessions together but they do not take their relationship past a certain point throughout much of the story.  But it actually works!  The tension between the two characters keeps the story moving forward and kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next:  The sexual tension between Jake and I is off the charts.  Im actually scared I might combust any second.  No joke.   Mikayla  They both want to be more they want it all.  I loved this story and loved the authors writing style.  Theres drama humor lots of sexual tension plenty of sexy times and a great story line.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves a hot young adult story.  Favorite quote:  Its a small touch our skin only lightly grazing but it feels so intimate like were more than what we are.  I know I want to be.  I want to be more than this.   Jake,4,False
502, . stars!!  Cage is a quick sexy hot fastpaced youcantputitdown book in the Corps Security series.  I absolutely loved this book and feel the author has really improved her writing style since the first book.  Lets start with Greg Cage.  Lord this man is HOT.  He is superprotective loyal and knows pretty much right away that Melissa is very different from any of the women he has been involved with and there are plenty!  He is used to being pursued not being the pursuer.  My body wants her that is no secret but level of want is borderline craving.  I need her.  Needing someone is not something I am used to.  No I am used to being needed...something this woman clearly doesnt want.  Cage and Melissa connect on a deeper level than just the hot sex but Melissa is a tough character.  She is used to being the strong one in her family and they rely on for everything.  She is very wary of men and relationships.  Will she let her guard down and let Cage in?  I wanted her to open her heart to Cage and trust him completely from the very beginning but she is too wary.  No even with the perfect sex I have learned enough from my sister to know it isnt wise to let a man have your heart.  When that happens it is only a matter of time before you lose yourself.  There are a lot of twists to the story and one very large secret that threatens to tear Cage and Melissa apart.  These two are so amazing together that I was on the edge of my seat until the very end.  Cage knows Melissa is his missing piece and I absolutely loved the way the author concludes this story.  I hope we get more of these two characters in future books.  I also loved the cast of supporting characters in this series and cannot wait for Beck and Dees story.  Corps Security is a favorite series!  Love all these guys and cant wait to read more.,4,False
503, . stars!!  I will admit I was drawn to this book by its gorgeous cover and what was inside did not disappoint!  I loved this book.  It is a story about real workingclass people with real problems and real passions.  And the sex is OFF THE CHARTS!  Kayden has a great job and a seemingly stable life but has had anger issues and a psycho exgirlfriend who made his life hell.  He and Sophia connect through Facebook one day and they begin to communicate and cant resist wanting to get to know each other better.  He was a friend of her older brother and is very sexy and has an allure that Sophia cant resist.  She leads a quiet life and is looking for a little excitement and yes even love.  Sophia is willing to take a risk on the handsome Kayden and falls quickly for him.  He really is a decent guy but his internal demons threaten their relationship.  I loved seeing these characters really develop and grow throughout this book and the story kept me turning the pages until the end.  I really was invested in these characters stories and felt a connection with them from the very beginning.  Untangle Me is a great debut from this author.  The characters have ordinary lives no billionaires here!  but the sex scenes are scorching and their problems are real.  The ending got a little dramatic but overall this was a very enjoyable read for me and I recommend it for anyone who wants a hot wellwritten and gripping story.  I also loved the New Orleans and Florida settings!  The author really got it right on both accounts.  Im looking to more books from this author in the future.

504,  / stars!  I loved this book!  It is so refreshing to read a modern funny and very sexy story that still has some emotional weight to it.  Andie is a hardworking lawyer stuck on a personal and professional path that might not be right for her.  It takes an impulsive trip to Vegas with friends to change everything.  She meets gorgeous cowboy Mack outrageous flirting ensues and they have a smokinghot one night stand.  Mack is actually refreshingly open and honest about his feelings almost right from the start which I really enjoyed about him:  It means if I want to get lucky with you I should take the risk and tell you whats on my mind because failing would be worse than never trying.  Andie has her life mapped out in detail and refuses to budge even when life throws her a few surprises.  She has a tough time believing that a guy like Mack could be interested in her.  He sounded so sincere it made my heart skip a beat.  How could a guy that good in bed and this gorgeous be so nice?  Andie must be in control of every detail of her life at all times.  I love how she evolves and grows as a character during Shine Not Burn and allows real life to change her rigid plans.  Theres lots of humor and some very hot sex in this book and I loved every minute.  And since Im picky about this kudos to Elle Casey for getting lots of legal details very accurate.  No spoilers but I absolutely loved the way the story concluded and I am really looking forward to more books like Shine Not Burn from Elle Casey!,4,False
505, Something isnt right.  Something isnt right at all.  I want to have sex.  I always want to have sex but right now I want to have sex with the giant pair of scissors Im currently holding in my hand and that wouldnt be good at all.  Sex and scissors should never mix.  Poor Gavin!  He is in love with Charlotte with whom he grew up and who unfortunately has friendzoned him.  Or so he thinks.  Love and Lists is the hilarious story of two twentysomethings and their group of friends who constantly think about sex and how to have it.  If youve read any of Tara Sivecs hysterically funny Chocolate Lovers books you know she is really foulmouthed and really funny.  Love and Lists is no different and it is a very cute and refreshing story.  I loved the main characters Gavin and Charlotte and the supporting cast.  This book also has a surprising change of course about midway through the story which I loved.  Will Gavin get the girl?  Will he move out of the friend zone?  Everything is answered in a very satisfying and funny way by the author.  If you want a dirty funny and fairly quick read dont miss Love and Lists!

506, Life is wild.  Yes it is dear readers yes it is.  I have a little secret: I started reading Stinger without even reading the book description.  Not one blurb not one review.  I had a very long and stressful week when I looked at my reading calendar and saw Stinger up on deck.  So I jumped right in.  I was hooked from the first page.  Mia Sheridan has written a finely developed emotionally charged and sexylicious book that I devoured very quickly.  Grace and Stinger literally run right into each other in Vegas while both are attending very different conferences: she a law conference he a porn convention.  Yes he is an adult film star.  Grace is a straightlaced law student hellbent on following a certain career and life path and she absolutely positively will not be pushed away from following her life plan!  So meeting a porn star doesnt exactly fit in with her wellmade plans.  I could fill this review with breathtaking quotes from Stinger but I would love it if you would give this story a chance and read it with fresh eyes.  The author has created a gorgeous sexy but very smart and sensitive hero in Stinger and a beautiful smart and kind heroine in Grace.  Neither is perfect yet neither one is afraid to admit when they have made a mistake.  There are also lots of essential supporting characters here some living some gone who populate this book and make it come alive.  The characters also undergo tremendous emotional growth in Stinger an essential development which is very often missing in a lot of books.  For the storyline the amazing sexy times and the fabulous characters I am giving Stinger five stars!,5,False
507, I have loved this entire series and FALLING AWAY is a fantastic addition to this amazing set of stories.  Bravo Ms.  Douglas!  Well done.  Note: although this book can be read as a standalone I cannot recommend Bully and Until You highly enough.  These books might not be everyones cup of tea but the sexual tension the constant pushandpull between the characters the engaging and thoughtful story lines are among my very favorite books.  I have two words: JAX TRENT.  Oh my lord.  This book was well worth the wait just to get inside that sexy beautiful head of his.  And K.C.?  I absolutely adored reading about her history her back story and her motivations.  This whole book was one delicious treat just begging to be unwrapped.  There are a lot of hot sexy times in this book the writing to me is flawless and yes there is a whopper of a teaser for AFLAME at the end!!  I for one am totally addicted to this series and cant wait for the next installment to be released.,5,False
508,  stars!  Until You is one of those rare books that is as good if not better than the first book in the series.  Bully is one of my favorite books ever and Until You has now taken its place as one of my alltime favorites.  Jared got under my skin and would not let go!  Ms.  Douglas is an incredibly skilled writer and gifted storyteller who has created some of the most memorable characters I have ever read.  If you have not read Bully I urge you to do so.  The story has twists and surprises and beautifullywritten characters.  And the author has continued Jared and Tates journey in Until You  I absolutely devoured this book and loved getting inside Jareds head.  And the pain he endured during his life well lets just say that I felt so much emotion for him I thought my heart would burst.  There is also plenty of steam in Until You and I loved the intense chemistry between Tate and Jared.  Until You is another amazing book from Ms.  Douglas.  It belongs on everyones mustread list!,5,False
509, . lovedeverytorturedminute stars!  I am a huge fan of Penelope Douglas and her books are perfection to me.  I was absolutely enthralled by Madoc and Fallon I had always LOVED Madoc and was thrilled he was getting his own story.  In Rival the author deals with lots of emotion heavy subjects and the pain of tragedy but she always throws in a little humor to lighten things up a bit.  Madoc and Fallon have a forbidden love but the way the author tells their story you fell nothing but empathy and love for them.  I absolutely love these characters and how the author never disappoints with the steam and chemistry factor.  Her writing is honest elegant and blunt and never filters out the harsh reality of life with heartsandbutterflies.  Madoc and Fallon have had some terrible things happen in their lives but they still turn out to be honest and good young adults.  This series is one of my favorites and I highly recommend that you start with Bully which is one of my alltime favorite books.  Tate and Jared do get an appearance here as well as Jax who is getting his own book soon yay!.  But Madoc and Fallon are the focus and they are fantastic characters.  I love Madocs hot toughguy exterior and Fallons offbeat personality.  Of course they are are hiding their pain and they must work through lots of miscommunication before we get to their very satisfying conclusion.

510, . stars!  One More Chance is an incredibly romantic and emotional story which is exactly what I have come to expect from Abbi Glines.  I loved Grant in Take a Chance and was curious to see where the author would take her characters on the next step in their story.  If you read Take a Chance you know that Harlow has a secret that could have led to the end of her beautiful relationship with Grant.  But in true Abbi Glines fashion she takes the reader on an incredible journey through all the emotions as she gives Grant and Harlow an incredible HEA.  I am a huge Abbi Glines fan and each story is a little different.  One More Chance is not a fun light beach read but instead a very romantic for me loving story that I devoured quickly.  If you love the Rosemary Beach characters then this is a mustread.  Grant is unwavering in his devotion to Harlow and she is a loving kind and beautiful character.  One of my favorite female heroines from Abbi Glines.  There are a few surprises here and I dont want to get too detailed.  Just enjoy this yummy book and all of the characters you have come to love from Abbi Glines Rosemary Beach series.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
511,  / stars!!  Abel is a VERY sexy and very romantic story.  As a character Abel is strong handsome and very charming.  I found it refreshing that he actually did not like to play games even though he and Nellie started off their sizzling relationship with a no strings attached declaration.  When he realizes how he really feels about Nellie he is very honest and straightforward in his behavior which I found to be very refreshing.  Abel is actually an Alpha male who is very sweet too.  Nellie is a very smart and strong character.  She is recovering from a disastrous marriage and very painful divorce and vows not to get involved in a serious relationship.  But along comes Abel who is several years younger by the way and she is literally swept off her feet.  Elizabeth Reyes does a great job of developing their very sexually intense relationship outside the bedroom too and the supporting cast of th Street characters are all very wellwritten and developed.  We are also introduced to some new supporting characters in Abel.  There is a very interesting storyline involving Abels boxing opponent and I loved reading about the boxing world.  I loved the mix of sports and romance in Abel.  There are some intensely emotional moments in the story which blend nicely with the hot sex scenes.  Elizabeth Reyes has  created very rich and sexy story and I look forward to reading more of her books!  Favorite Quotes:  Only three types of people tell the truth: Kids the drunk and the  angry.   Abel  Youre mine Nellie.   Abel,4,False
512, WOW!!!  When I finished reading this book I honestly did not know what genre to put this book in!  And I was afraid to give anything away on Goodreads.  I literally had to email the author to ask her explicitly which category she thought this story should be in.  It is NOT dark/taboo/forbidden.  What it most defitnitely is: sweeping grand thrilling exciting heartbreaking joyous and lifeaffirming.  and unlike ANYTHING youve ever read from Pepper Winters.  Enjoy the ride!  The author has now revealed the inspiration behind the story and the full blurb on her website check it out!!  Love doesnt live in first glances.  Life doesnt dwell in second chances.  Our path exists in unseen messages.  Yes this is a long book but trust me when I say that I flew through the pages.  The story revolves around Estelle Evermore who is a rising singer and songwriter but who is desperate to fly back home after being on a grueling tour.  There are ominous signs everywhere warning her not to get on the plane.  The sense of foreboding is almost suffocating!  Also on her flight is Galloway Oak and although these two are strangers in a very short time they will become dependent on each other for their very lives.  Pepper Winters is one of my favorite dark romance authors.  To say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement.  While there is dark sense of foreboding Unseen Messages is in no way dark at all.  It is a finely detailed epic romance with thrilling elements and stunning settings.  When the characters were exhausted sunburned and starving I felt their pain.  When they suffer unimaginable loss I felt their heartache.  I connected with the characters and became immersed in their story of survival.  If you are looking for something very different to read try Unseen Messages.  The ending was surprising and beautiful and uplifting.  I applaud the author for stepping outside her comfort zone and giving us Estelle and Galloway.  They are two memorable characters that will stay with me for a long time.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
513, Wow.  This story will follow you long after you finish reading.  I absolutely love dark and angsty books hello Captive in the Dark and Comfort Food so the story line was perfect.

515, Surprisingly sexy story!  Grey suddenly finds herself in a situation where she needs to do anything in order to survive.  She is young far from her home in Georgia at college in California with no way to pay her tuition or living expenses.  She has been alienated from her father a very strict pastor who would definitely NOT approve of the choices she is forced to make.  The first part of the book started out a little slow for me but then WOW!  When Grey as Gracie her stage name meets famous actor Dawson Kellor at the dance club the book really takes off.  He is immediately drawn to Greys kind nature and goodness.  Dawson doesnt answer but this isnt a pause this is the silence of a man who knows nothing he says will make it okay so he doesnt say anything.  Its perfect.  After a long moment he tugs me closer and murmurs Let me hold you.  Im still totally tensed now.  Hold me?  Yeah.  Just hold you.  No pressure.  Its not going anywhere.  Just be in the moment with me.  Dawson is a worldweary Hollywood actor and it turns out that Grey is actually his new assistant on his current movie.  Despite her innocence and inexperience she and Dawson fall for each other.  I enjoyed the Hollywood behindthescenes aspect of the storyline.  The writing in Stripped is excellent fastpaced and VERY sexy.  Grey and Dawson really heat up the pages!  They have an undeniable chemistry.  I also liked that Dawson really doesnt play games with Grey.  He is very open and honest about his feelings for Grey and he really treats her with love and care:  Then something odd happens: Dawson presses a soft kiss to my temple.  Its.  tender.  Its a kiss designed to soothe to comfort.  Not to ignite desire or passion.  It confuses me and it makes me feel.  .loved.  Cared for.  I love what the title of the book stands for its not what you think!  Ms.  Wilder has written characters that I actually cared about and has written some supersteamy scenes.  Stripped is a very sexy story that totally surprised me with its storyline and characters.  Enjoy!  A copy of the book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
516, . stars!!  First let me say that these characters are some of my favorite fictional characters and I am a huge fan of the The Artists Trilogy.  I highly recommend the series they are some of the most thrilling touching sexy and gritty books you will ever read.  Dirty Angels is a standalone novel and you absolutely can dive in without reading any of the other books but just make sure you pick them up at some point!  Dirty Angels is without question very very violent very very dirty and sexy.  It is another WILD ride from Karina Halle!!  The story takes place among Mexican drug cartel members in Mexico but at its heart it is a tender well kind of and beautiful love story.  Javier commits unspeakable acts but he is also a human being and becomes obsessed with Luisa after he kidnaps her and holds her for ransom The problem is that Luisa has gone from one violent and dysfunctional man to another.  She is incredibly resilient and strong but finds herself drawn to the very alluring Javier.  I found the sex scenes to be incredibly alluring and the alternating POVs worked perfectly here.  I highly recommend this book if you want to read a story that is not all rainbows and unicorns but is instead filled with gritty characters painful choices incredibly satisfying love scenes and some wild violent action.  Another fantastic story from Karina Halle.  TeamJavier all the way baby.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False
517, The first two books in this series left lots of unanswered questions which are all answered in thrilling fashion in Panic!  I loved the way the author let us in on Rook and Ronins histories.  Wow!  I wasnt expecting these stories.  The last half of Panic is very fastpaced and almost morphed into a thriller which was fine by me.  I absolutely love all the characters in these stories even the ones I love to hate but I really love Ford.  Rook turns into a very strong heroine and you can see how resilient she really is.  But she is far from perfect which is one of the things I liked about this story.  I liked how she interacted with Ford and in particular there is a scene between her and Ford that could have taken a predicatble turn but didnt.  I love a dual POV book and the author does not dissapoint with giving us both Rooks and Ronins POV.  There are also plenty of steamy scenes in this book.  Overall a very satisfying conclusion to Rook and Ronins story.  And more Ford please!,4,False
518, I recommend All of You to New Adult readers who are looking for something a little different.  The reason?  The hot male lead is a virgin!  Bennett Reynolds the sexy tattooartist neighbor of nursing student Avery is looking for a loving and meaningful relationship and not just a random hookup.  Which is not to say he hasnt had some experience.  Damn it Bennett I panted.  How in the hell do you know how exactly to drive me insane?  I said I was a virgin Avery.  Not a saint.  Or even a monk apparently I mumbled.  I felt him smile against my skin.  The main character Avery keeps giving away pieces of herself by hooking up with other guys but she keeps her real feelings locked away.  With Bennetts help she finds the strength to confront the demons in her past and confront the past demons which keep her from forming a loving relationship.  I liked how strong her character was.  I also liked Averys relationship with her best friends which was funny and realistic.  The best part of All of You was without a doubt Bennett!  I loved that he was both sexy and romantic artistic and extremely honest.  No gameplaying here.  I loved the dialogue between Bennett and Avery and yes they had tons of chemistry together.  All in all Christina Lees debut novel is a very refreshing and yet very sexy read.  I am looking to more from her in the future!,4,False
519, . stars!  In this followup to one of my favorite books of all time Sempre JM Darhower takes us on a tensionfilled ride though the inner workings of a mob family.  Carmine and Haven are forced to make heartbreaking and difficult decisions early in this story that lead to a surprising and thrilling read.  Ms.  Darhower is an extremely gifted writer and she has crafted memorable characters that will stay with you long after you finish this story.  Sempre opened with one of the most heartbreaking and harrowing scenes I have ever read.  Carmine and Haven are two of my favorite fictional characters and I had been waiting anxiously for their story to continue.  Sempre: Redemption is very much a gripping crime story but really delivers on the emotion and romance.  I was very sad to see Carmine and Havens story come to an end but the author delivers an absolutely fantastic conclusion!  Overall Sempre:Redemption is a beautifully written dramatic and ultimately satisfying journey.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False
520, . stars!!  I absolutely loved Lola Starks first book in this series Tattered Love and couldnt wait for the second book!  Conflicted Love is the story of Teeny and Trip who we first met in Tattered Love.  I highly recommend reading Book  first to get a feel for the background story of these characters and also because its a surprisingly engaging and sexy story.  Teeny is a tough character very independent and finds herself in an unexpected situation after a hot night with the very sexy tatted and pierced Trip.  She really doesnt want to fall for Trip but he does some pretty amazing things to prove himself a worthy partner.  He has never been in a lasting relationship but to his credit really fights his way into Teenys life.  Lots of really hot sex ensues along with some very funny moments due to her pregnancy.  I would have liked a little more depth to this story but overall Conflicted Love is a fairly quick really hot read with lots of very sexy and likable characters.

522, Absolute perfection from beginning to end!  It begins with a whimper but ends in a bang.  Tiffany Resisz has written what might be her best book so far!  The story of how Eleanor and Soren first met is told in intimate detail as Nora tells the tale over one one night of passion with her lover.  The Saint is told in flashback and although you might think you know the story the funny tragic and sexy details come to life at Tiffany Reiszs gifted hands.  When we met he said Its a pleasure to finally meet you.  Wed both been waiting for each other like it was meant to be that we would find and love each other.  How Soren finally brings the wild and disobedient Eleanor under control is fascinating.  Her relationship with her parents is heartbreaking and the blooming of Soren Nora and Kingsleys inevitable and lifelong bond is a beautiful and very sexy thing to watch unfold.  I could not put this book down and felt like I was spending time with some old if not very dangerous friends.  I loved the switching back and forth between past and present as an adult Nora tells the story to her current lover no spoilers as to his identity!  The Saint is another perfectlywritten highly erotic novel from Ms.  Reisz with a healthy dose of sarcasm and humor and even some religious eduction and philosophy thrown in.  Dont miss this one!

523, . stars!!  I am always intrigued to read a novel written from a male POV.  I am equally fascinated by pen names and even when the writer professes to be one gender or the other or leaves it open to the imagination such as BG Harlen I still wonder at the back of my mind whether the author is a male or female.  Do some female writers have a decidedly masculine POV?  Yes there are several that come to mind.  Do some male writers have a feminine flavor to their writing?  It seems so.  And so we come to the fascinating Thou Shalt Not.  I loved Lukes story as well as JJ Rossums writing style and dont want to be pigeonholed into thinking that the author is male or female.  Thats just me.  Either way its a very sexy and engaging book with plenty of steamy scenes to satisfy even the most jaded erotic romance reader such as myself.  The story carries some very weighty themes domestic violence adultery the nature of beauty but the book is very fastpaced and satisfying.  Will Luke keep himself out of trouble with April?  Will he learn to really love someone again?  No spoilers here but the author answers these questions while exploring what qualities are really important and what makes someone worthy of love.  This book has a very interesting conclusion that some readers will love and some might find a little challenging.  I loved it and cant wait to read more from this author.

525, . stars!  What can I say about Tarryn Fisher other than she is one of my favorite writers?  Her style is powerful clean bold and unapologetic.  Mud Vein is no exception.  Senna and Isaacs story is not what you think and not at all what you would you expect.  This book totally took me off guard because I didnt read any reviews with spoilers in them.  Like her earlier books The Love Me with Lies series this story is brutally honest and is not a heartsandflowers sugarysweet romance.  The plot is incredibly inventive and different and stunning as well.  I fell in love with Isaac and by the end of the book also really cared about Senna even though as with other characters written by Ms.  Fisher she is a prickly sort.  I did not see the ending of this book coming and it is really best if you dont know the ending as well.  Mud Vein is another incredibly written book by Tarryn Fisher.  She poured her heart and soul into this book and it really shows.  I highly recommend Mud Vein.  You wont soon forget it.,5,False

527,  stars for The Mistress!  This is an incredibly rich and completely satisfying conclusion to the Original Sinners series.  All of the characters are brought together in The Mistress and their rich and complex stories are told in a very clever and gripping way.  I cant do justice to a book that is so masterfully written and so filled with erotic and sensual images that I literally could not put it down.  You must read The Original Sinners series first so that you will be familiar with the intricate and complex histories of the gorgeous and fierce characters created by Tiffany Reisz.  In The Mistress Nora is forced to recount stories of her past with Kingsley and Soren.  Youre my favorite monster she said against his lips.  She felt pleasure with other men ecstasy even sometimes...but only when Soren was inside her did she feel whole.  Soren and Kingsley spring into action to rescue Nora and both recall their memories of their relationship with Nora and with each other.  Soren could not live in a world without Nora.  Kingsley could not live in a world without Soren.  Wesley also rushes to help rescue Nora along with Zacharys wife Grace.  Sorens niece Laila also forms an important part of the authors elaborate story of love submission and erotica a story that does not contain one false move or one unimportant character.  I dont want to give away any spoilers but suffice it to say that Tiffany Reisz has created a brilliant cast of characters and a story that will challenge you thrill you and leave you breathless with anticipation.  I was on the edge of my seat while reading The Mistress hoping that Soren and Noras unbreakable bond would get then through this latest crisis.  The fire of her teenage infatuation with Soren had burned itself out years ago.  In its flames a love made of iron had been forged.  It could survive any blow any trial.  The ending of this story was incredibly emotionally satisfying and perfect for each character.  The Mistress is a brilliant ending to an absolutely amazing series.   stars  Thanks to Harlequin and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.,5,False

533, ARC received in return for an honest review  Wowwhat a wild ride.  As a huge fan of the Edge of Never I picked up this book without knowing anything about the story I only knew that Andrew and Camryn would be making a cameo appearance.  Bray and Elias met as children and grew up best friends Bray was pretty much ignored by her family and suffered from benign neglect.  She seemed like the wild child but really she was afraid to form bonds or attachments to people because she didnt understand that the other people could actually care for her.  Elias was in love and devoted to Bray no matter what.  This New Adult book contained some pretty spicy sex scenes but I felt they fit in with the story of the young characters as they grew and explored the world and their relationships.  A shocking event occurs and Bray and Elias find themselves on the road.  Many adventures ensue and they meet up with another group young wanderers.  I never thought there would be a HEA to this story based on their almost daily physical struggles and Brays battle with bipolar disorder.  depression.  Elias would never leave a Bray no matter what so it was difficult to see how there would be a satisfying conclusion to this book but there was.  I read several very negative reviews of this book and I dont agree at all.  This book has enough drama emotion and sexy times to satisfy any fan of New Adult books.  Even though the ending seemed bleak at one point I was very happy to see Bray and Elias get the ending they so deserved.,4,False

Beg was a total surprise and was a fastpaced sexy read!  The characters are all very welldeveloped and the Los Angeles settings are written with a lot of thought and description.  I loved the characters of Monica and Jonathan and the storyline is very engaging.  I recommend this very sexy novella when you need a hot dose of a very charming alpha male and a smart spirited heroine.  My only complaint about BEG...it was too short!

539, MidLife Love is an entertaining story with very strong characters and lots and lots of very steamy sex!  I enjoyed reading a book where the main characters werent  years old.  Claire and Jonathan actually had substance to their characters and I loved the youngerguyolderwoman story.  This is the perfect book to lose yourself in and just enjoy the story.  I loved the San Francisco setting and the secondary characters were wellthoughtout also.  I felt that Claire could have stopped doubting her relationship with Jonathan a little earlier on I mean here was a smart successful businessman who clearly had real feelings for her and wasnt bothered at all by their age difference.  Claires continued insecurities were the only sticking point for me.  The ending more than made up for that and anyone who loves a HEA will love this book!  I would have loved even a short prologue though but all in all a great escapist read with a neat and tidy conclusion.,4,False

541, I was totally hooked into Worth the Fight from the first page and absolutely fell in love with Nico Hunter!  We meet attorney Elle James who is a total workaholic and keeps her steady boyfriend pretty much at arms length.  Everything in her life is emotionless and neatly planned just like she wants it.  Elle doesnt want any drama or surprises in her life.  Of course all of this changes in a heartbeat when she meets MMA fighter Nico Hunter and she knows her life will never be the same.  Ive never seen a body like his so close before.  It just doesnt seem real.  Both of his arms are covered in tattoos it looks like hes wearing colorful sleeves only he has no shirt on.  They intertwine and wrap around his bulging biceps and I get the urge to trace a path from the first splat of ink to the last with my tongue.  My bodys reaction to him is unlike anything Ive ever felt before.  These arent feelings that Im used to they seem to come out of nowhere and are uncontrollable.  There are very painful reasons why Elle keeps her life relatively everything dramafree and Nico too has had a traumatic event in his life which is revealed very early on in the book.  Luckily for Elle Nico knows what he wants and goes after it and wow!  Nico is one HOT Alpha male a really gorgeous sexy and actually NICE guy who tries to break down the walls around Elles heart and emotions.  I know I could have taken it further after that kiss.  But I dont want one night with Elle.  I want more.  I have no idea why but I do.  A lot fucking more.  I absolutely love Nico!  He took my breath away!  He is tough sensitive strong and tender all at once.  He loves his family and they form a tight bond around him.  He has a loyal group of friends and trainers around him.

542, We loved this latest installment in the Maddox Brothers saga!  Trent is hardloving hardworking loyal and completely devoted to Cami.  She is a good girl dealing with a bad family situation and trying to keep up with two jobs school and TJ her longdistance boyfriend who is does not seem to have much time for her because of his mysterious job in California.  What we loved best about this story is the devotion of Trenton to Cami.  At first he comes off as a player but he is far from that and when he makes his true feelings known to Cami he is totally swoony.  Hes ubersexy hot and protective.  Because Ive been in love with you since grade school Chamomile.  And everyone knew it.  Everyone.  We also loved Cami she is dealing with more than her share of stress between her seriously dysfunctional family school juggling two jobs and her mystery boyfriend TJ in California.  We both really liked this book because of our devotion to the Maddox Brothers BUT we did not like how Trents longtime love for Cami was not described in more detail maybe through a memory or another scene or two.  That led to a little bit of a disconnect between the two main characters.  We are sworn to secrecy about giving away any spoilers but be aware there is a SHOCKER of an abrupt surprise ending!  Cathy figured it out from the beginning but I was clueless.  And the author just announced that the next installment will be BEAUTIFUL REDEMPTION the oldest Maddox Brothers story.  We will definitely read the next book because who doesnt absolutely love the Maddox Brothers??  ARC provided by Atria in return for an honest review,4,False
543, I dont usually read a lot of paranormal books so King Hall was a little something different for me!  This is a magical imaginative story that follows Lily a young prodigy who is suddenly forced to become a leader along with three other friends.  Lily is a hybrid which is very dangerous in the mystical world created by Scarlett Dawn.  The actionpacked story follows young Lily as she experiences loss selfdoubt and many epic challenges on her path to becoming the leader she is meant to be.  The author has created some great supporting characters in Ezra Jack and Pearl.  I especially enjoyed reading about the relationship and strong connection between Lily and Ezra the sexy Vampire.  There is lots of talk about sex and sexual tension in this book but nothing too explicit.  King Hall ends with a cliffhanger but it is the kind of ending that leaves you ready for the next installment in this story!  This book was a very different read and I recommend it for anyone interested in stories about magical mystical worlds.  I received this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.,4,False
544, Thank you to Mia Sheridan for the amazing opportunity to read an ARC of Leos Chance!  And to all of the readers who have experienced Leo you must read this book.  I was absolutely blown away by the writing the characters the story and the very very steamy sex!!  This book had everything I love about a great book.  Mia Sheridan is an absolutely amazing writer.  This series is going on my list of favorite books.  Please read Leo Book One in this series before you read Leos Chance.  It is told from Evies POV and you will be lost on some of the details and characters in this book without having read Leo.  I LOVE Leo!  He is hiding a terrible trauma desperate to get close to Evie and trying to get closure on his very troubled past.  Leo and Evie both grew up in the foster system and he vowed to return for her when she turned .  That became impossible and now  years later he enters her life again:  After only a couple days of following Evie I was pretty damn sure that I was already even more in love with her than I was when I was  years old.  Now I just had to figure out what the hell to do.  Nothing I write here will do justice to this incredible story of abuse shame betrayal and ultimately honesty and the power of love.  Leos flashbacks to his time in the foster care system are gutwrenching.  I cant even imagine doing the research for this part of the story.  My heart went out to these fictional characters and to all kids in the foster care system.  Leos feelings for Evie are incredibly intense even though he is filled with doubt and selfloathing.  But Leos Chance is not just the story of two broken kids in the foster care system.  It is an amazing love story with some graphic and supersteamy sex scenes!  Worlds Greatest indeed!  This is the second most incredible kiss of my life.  The first was with the same girl.  This book contained one of the best epilogues I have ever read.  Leos Chance is a mustread.  I cant wait to read more from Mia Sheridan!Leos ChanceMia Sheridan,5,False
545, ./ stars!  This was a totally surprising read by a wonderful author!  Mary Whitney is a fantastic writer and she gives us an absolutely beautiful story about first love.  The story tells us what happened years before between Nicki and Adam.  Nicki has never really gotten over Adam even though they were very close while in high school.  Adam helped Nicki cope with the sudden death of her sister and Nicki falls for him.  This book has a much more emotional feel than most stories about high schoolers.  I felt that both Nicki and Adam were very mature for their age which I appreciated.  All in all this is a wonderful story with very wellwritten characters.  The author throws a few things in the way of Nicki and Adam finally being together and the ending will really leave you wanting to read much more from Mary Whitney!

547, Bingo.  Fuse lit.  Crashed is an absolutely breathtaking and stunning conclusion to the Driven Trilogy!  I dont ever write long reviews but for some reason it has been very difficult for me to put into words the emotions that this book instilled in me.  It has been a bag of mixed emotions saying goodbye to Colton and Rylee.  Spiderman.  Batman.  Superman.  Ironman  I had a million theories about where this book would go after the absolutely heartstopping ending of Fueled.  It is a tribute to the authors incredible talent that all of my theories were wrong and Colton and Rylees story took me on an emotional journey that has stayed with me weeks after finishing this book.  I felt every gutwrenching scene every emotional high and low and every triumph right down to my very soul.  There are some absolutely beautiful scenes in Crashed and there are some absolutely soulpunching nailbiting ones too.  Each scene felt essential to the book and I also loved how every character was fully explored in Crashed.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of Crashed but yet at the same time I didnt want to say goodbye to Colton and Rylee.  This is a substantial juicy story that is meant to be savored and enjoyed.  And the Epilogue!  Kristy Bromberg has earned a place in my heart previously reserved only for Kristen Ashley and Jodi Ellen Malpas with the fantastic Epilogue in Crashed.  Remember hurting is feeling and feeling is living and isnt it good to be alive?  Coltons painful past is fully explored in Crashed and many questions are answered.  Rylee continues to be one of the strongest heroines around and had me cheering and weeping throughout many parts of the book.  The plot is very inventive and there are several relationships that I hope the author will explore in the future.  Do not miss Crashed.  It is absolute perfection A to motherfucking Z!

548, Shes my motherfing checkered flag.  Easily one of my favorite books this year.  Disclaimer: I am no writer so anything I say here will not be able to do justice to the amazing writing talent of K. Bromberg!  So a few months ago a book called Driven landed in my in box along with a lovely email asking if Cathy and I would be interested in reading the book.  Other obligations interfered until finally over the summer I began reading what turned out to be one of my absolute favorite series ever!  As a matter of fact I started reading Driven yes I know this is the Fueled Blog Tour!  while I was on a family vacation that involved a lot of driving.  Thankfully I have three other drivers in my family because every chance I got I hopped in the back seat with my Kindle and said Oh a twohour drive?  No problem!  Lets go!  Thats how obsessed I was with Colton and Rylee.  I could not get enough of them.  I could not wait to dive into Fueled.  And the author literally grabs your heart right from the very beginning and does.  Not.  Let.  Go.  My heart was pounding out of my chest for most of this book.  And its not just the amazingly steamy sex scenes between Colton and Rylee.  Its the actions of Colton its Rylees reactions its the secondary characters the racing scenes the emotional connection between Rylee and Colton.  Well you get the picture.  My blogging partner Cathy read Fueled after release day and was very skeptical about my ranting and raving about Colton and Rylee.  Well she loved it MORE than Driven and she is almost always disappointed with sequels!  Fueled has inspired a lot of fervor from readers and the author kindly responds to every comment email and Tweet about Colton and Rylee.  She is clearly as passionate about her characters as we are.  We RACE you Kristy!  So theres our little review.  No detailed plot descriptions here because this book should most definitely be read without any spoilers because the story is just wow.  Will you have a book hangover after reading Fueled?  Oh yeah.  But please dont bother the author!  She needs to write CRASHED ASAP!,5,False

550,  / emotionfilled stars for this beautifully written story!  I absolutely loved this story about Cali a girl whose life is empty closed off and bleak even though outwardly she plays the part of the popular carefree party girl.  Cali devotes her time and energy to torturing Logan planning one elaborate prank after another.  Why does she hate Logan so much?  The author keeps us guessing only revealing that once upon a time Logan was the best friend of Calis brother Ben.  The story kept me turning the pages to find out why Logan allowed Cali to hate him so much and what actually happened to Ben:  Our rivalry is beautiful because it makes us both forget about everything else.  It turns out that Cali and Logan actually have a lot more in common than Cali thought at first.  They both love poetry which plays a very important role in Two Roads.  As much as Calis hateful behavior frustrated me at times I absolutely loved Logan!  He is a gorgeous nerd who allows Cali to vent her emotions and hatred towards him and just does not back down.  Logan sees the real Cali underneath her hateful and mean treatment of him and tries to help her let go of her anger and tries to shows her that her life can have meaning.  He is funny sensitive and caring.  Although he plays along with Calis constant pranks and her relentless hatred of him he realizes what they have together.  Will Cali ever recognize what is right in front of her?  Will Logan let Cali push him away?  Two Roads answers all of these questions in a very emotionally satisfying conclusion.  And trust me Logan has now become of my favorite book boyfriends.  Because you stole my heart Cali he whispers running his hand along my cheeks.  You stole my heart and now you wont let me have yours.  Two Roads is a wonderfullywritten emotionfilled story that shows that no matter how hard you search sometimes love is right in front of you.  Well done L.M.  Augustine!  Looking forward to many more books from this very talented writer.  Favorite quote:  I guess I love The Road Not Taken because its saying that no matter what you always get a choice in life.,5,False
551, Fantastic!  Perfect example of why R.K.Lilley is one of my favorite authors.  Character connection great storyline and offthecharts needacoldshower sex scenes.  Bad ThingsR.K.  Lilley  R.K.  Lilley is one of my favorite writers and boy does she deliver an amazing story in Bad Things!  I could not get enough of Danika and Tristan and I am anxiously awaiting more of their story.  There is no instalove here.  The author takes the time to build a deep friendship between Danika and Tristan but they do have an undeniable chemistry that they cannot ignore.  Danika has a long list of strict rules for relationships and Tristan well lets just say that Tristan falls into the badboy category which Danika is trying to avoid.  Danika is totally honest and open with Tristan.  He is who he is and in his own way is honest with Danika too.  If you have read the Up in the Air series not necessary for this book but an amazing series you know that Bad Things takes place several years before James Cavendish meets Bianca and that Tristan gets clean and sober.  You also know that something very tragic happens between Tristan and Danika.  There are several fantastic plot twists that I did not see coming in Bad Things.  There are also several welldeveloped side characters with great stories.  But Bad Things focuses on the EXPLOSIVE attraction and ohsosteamy sex between Tristan and Danika and the author really knows how to deliver some heartpounding sex scenes!  Writers take note: this is how you write contemporary romance!  Oh I like this one I thought watching his throat work as he swallowed.  A sexy man who liked sarcastic women...   Danika  You feel so good sweetheart.  I swear nothings ever felt better in my whole fucking life.   Tristan  I could not out this book down.

553, Rock My World is a very sexy entry in the Black Falcon series!  It is a fairly quick and very entertaining read.  The story follows Aubrey and Zach Riffs real name as they return to Aubreys home to meet with her father over a legal matter.  Except that Aubrey hasnt told her parents she was bringing home her tattooed rocker boyfriend!  The awkward situation with Aubreys very conservative parents only adds to Zachs insecurities as he struggles to convince himself that he is good enough for Aubrey.  Much drama and hot sex then ensues in this very steamy novella.  Will Zach and Aubrey let outside influences drive them apart?  Will Aubrey cave in to her conservative parents and leave Zach?  Everything comes to a very satisfying conclusion in this story.  As usual Michelle Valentine really delivers a catchy plot with very memorable characters and some scorching hot scenes.  I love Aubrey and Zach.  Rock My World is a great entry in the Black Falcon series and Im looking forward to reading Trips story next in Rock the Beat!  Rock My WorldMichelle A. Valentine,4,False
554, . stars!!  I absolutely LOVE Emma Chases writing style and Twisted is a delicious treat for fans of Drew and Kate!  This book begins two years after Drew and Kate begin dating and they are living together in New York City.  Their chemistry is still HOT and sizzling of course because this is the Tangled series after all but a very serious misunderstanding occurs which threatens the couples Happily Ever After.  What could be a simple event in the hands of another writer becomes an emotional roller coaster that kept me reading this book almost in one sitting.  There is tons of snappy dialogue and some very funny moments mostly thanks to Kates friend Delores.  There are a lot of great twists and turns in this book and although I thought I would not be hooked on Kates POV I absolutely loved reading her POV.  She is smart witty funny and sensitive.  But I think my my favorite part of the whole book might be the Epilogue which is written in my boyfriends oops I mean DREWs POV.  The wonderful cast of supporting characters makes their appearances in Twisted and I loved each and every one of them.  Twisted is a funny witty intelligent and very sexy book and I cannot wait for Tamed!  He pulls the blanket up over both of us and holds me tight against him.  And it makes me feel precious.  He makes me feel that way.  Always.  Cherished.  Adored.  But to know perfectionto touch it breathe it in every dayand then have it taken away?  Loss is agony.  And every inch of my skin aches with it.  Even when I hated you I loved you.   Drew  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False

557, Sexy hot and absolutely exhilarating!  It is kind of scary to read a book from an author who has given you one of your most beloved book boyfriends ever.  Remington Tate is still my true love but Greyson King has stolen my heart.  I loved everything about Rogue the emotion the story the writing and especially the very dark and beautiful Greyson Zero King.  I couldnt put Rogue down and found myself consumed by Greyson and Melanies story.  The book swept me along for a hot and delicious ride filled with emotion happiness and some trepidation.  Would Melanie tame her guy?  Would Greyson be able to keep his secrets from Melanie without destroying them both?  Melanie has been unlucky at love and falls hard for Greyson.  Hes a ten.  Ive never ever been with a ten.  And the way that he looks at me... Ive seen that look before.  The look that Remington Tate gives Brooke.  That look.  Hes giving it to me and Im dying inside.  Can I die from one look?  And if one look can kill me then what would one touch do?  So Melanie and Greyson have unbelievably hot chemistry but the tension comes from whether their relationship will survive once his true relationship with her is revealed.  Greyson is everything I love about a Katy Evans hero  hes possessive protective hot and very demanding.  I absolutely loved the writing and the story as well as the dual POV.  Rogue is a totally exhilarating sexy ride from one of my very favorite authors and I cant wait to read more from Katy!  With you and me there are no givens.  No rules.  Just what we want.  And I want every inch of you.  I want what youve given no one.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,5,False
558, WOW!!  What a ride!!  Ripped was an unexpected gem from one of my favorite authors ever and I loved it from beginning to end!  Pandora is a feisty strong takenoprisoners heroine who came charging out of the gate at a hundred miles an hour.  From the opening scene of Ripped when she and her best friend are planning a payback to Mackenna to the very end Pandora grabbed my heart and didnt let go.  Pandora has always felt crushed and alone after her first and only love broke her heart.  And then went on to sing about it!  Her life has become focused on getting revenge on the only man she has ever loved left her with not a look back.  Mackenna was her true love before he became a famous rock star and to her horror he wrote a hit song about her!  She has spent years hating him.  When her prank goes wrong to stay out of trouble she must make a deal that involves her going on tour with the band.  Will she be able to come to terms with what Mackenna did to her all those years ago?  Will Mackenna be able to make her understand why he did what he did?  Sex sex and rocknroll.  Mackenna is a sex god and Katy Evans doesnt let you forget it!  Ripped actually has more humor in it than the other books in this series and I loved it!!  And of course lots and lots of heart in this one.  Ripped is classic Katy Evans with a twist!  The heroine is angry and heartbroken but tough as nails.  The hero is sexy as hell possessive and tenacious.  I highlighted so much from this book that Ill just share my favorite quotes here:  Stupid girl attracted to bad boy V card handed over heart broken end of story.  Im not even worried about him.  Im familiar with Pandora and her mistake  letting all kinds of bad shit into the world when she opened the box.  Ive always been at war with my name.  Im angry at it because right away it makes me think I can never really be good.  Im a jinx.  God Im such a bluffer.  Black clothes black nails?  Im a pussy.  An innocent little kitty pretending to be Catwoman.  This man could kill me over and over until my nine lives are done.  I absolutely adored Ripped and have now added Mackenna to my list of favorite book boyfriends!  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review,5,False
559, Katy Evans has written an intensely sexy book which perfectly ends Brooke and Remys roller coaster ride that began in Real.  Katys intimate portrayal of Remys innermost thoughts and feelings is always fascinating and at times heartbreaking as the reader witnesses his constant struggle to love be loved and simply live in the world.  Remy is not a standalone book by any means and I recommend you read Real and Mine first.  Katy has created an unforgettable character in Remington Tate and her books have resonated with legions of fans myself included.  I absolutely loved reading Remys POV and devoured this book almost in one sitting.  Remy is almost painfully flawed as a human being but is also desperate find love and some kind of balance in his life.  His struggles are for me the crux of this story.  I loved him through all his highs and lows and hoped he would get his HEA!  You know you are getting loads of steamy sex if you have read Real and Mine.  And Katy Evans really delivers on the hot and VERY primal sex scenes in Remy.  Whew!  It is Remys POV after all.  Remy and Brookes scenes together are totally hot.  And very very satisfying.  I absolutely loved the conclusion to Remy and Brookes story but I was a little sad to reach the end of this book!  Like all of Katys fervent fans l feel very connected to Remy and Brooke and hope that we hear a little more from them in the next two books Ripped and Raw.  I give Remy  swoony stars!

560, I love her more than anyone should love anything.  The kind of love that either fills you up or eats away at you.  I love her at my own risk.  I love her dangerously.  I call this book The One Where Karina Halle Rips Your Heart Out and Stuffs It Down Your Throat.  In AWMCTL we feel every drop of Dexs anguish about his feelings for Perry.  It is told from Dexs POV and because this is a spoilerfree review lets just say that the author really knows how to wring every drop of honesty and truth from her characters.  Shut the fuck up man.  Get over it.  Shape up or ship out.  Dont think I wasnt yelling those things in my head.  But when the fuck did my head and heart get along anyway?  They were mortal enemies now sworn to rip each other to shreds.  But since this part of the EIT series after all there is still plenty of action to go around.  When Dex is abruptly summoned by Little Fifteen aka Ada to help Perry he doesnt hesitate to jump right back into the fray to save Perry from mortal danger.  Youre my light in all this madness Perry I whispered knowing she couldnt hear me.  Obviously I cant wait to see where the author takes Dex and Perry in Come Alive Book  to be released on June  !And With Madness Comes the LightKarina Halle,5,False
561, Rare and Precious Things is a beautiful lyrical book taking the reader on a wonderful journey with two beloved characters Ethan and Brynne as they navigate the sometimetreacherous waters of newlymarried couples.  Raine Miller has written a fantastic intriguing and SUPER hot conclusion to Ethan and Brynnes story.  Could there be a hotter book husband than Ethan Blackstone?  I really dont think so!  Ethan filled me up on a steady thrust his hands at my hips for leverage.  He made that breathy groan of pleasure that I loved to hear from him as he sank into me.  Feel that my beauty.  All of itjust for you.  As a newlywed and expectant mother Brynne still feels a little insecure even though Ethan is clearly devoted to her.  She is a plainspoken woman and not yet totally comfortable in the rarefied atmosphere of Ethan Blackstones world.  Good sex wasnt love.  For me honest devotion and loyalty was love.  Ethan sees Brynne as his safe harbor and his comfort from his inner turmoil and PTSD.  The alternating POVs work perfectly here and kept me turning the pages late into the night.  Raine Miller writes THE most amazing sex scenes without being cliche or overdone.  Of course her characters have a deep connection after all they have been through together but it is still vital that I feel emotionally connected too and I absolutely felt connected to Ethan and Brynne.  Ethan is still battling his inner demons and Brynne must still contend with characters from her painful past.  Nothing in the story is rushed nothing is as expected and all is brought to an incredibly satisfying conclusion in Rare and Precious Things.  A must read!

562, . stars!!  E.K.  Blair has written yet another extremely gripping and powerful story covering the events surrounding Candaces trauma but told from Ryans POV.  I am a big fan of the male POV so this book was right up my alley even though it deals with some highly sensitive subjects.  If you have read the first two books in the Fading series which I highly recommend then you know that these books tackle some very tough issues including rape and its aftermath.  Falling is beautifully and emotionally written and even includes a healthy dose of romance and steamy scenes.  Ryans personality has been shaped by extreme violence in his past and we get some insight into the initially coldhearted SOB that he was before he met Candace.  Parts of this book are very difficult to read but the main characters all grow and change and find some measure of peace by the conclusion of the story.  The author has written a fabulous ending that did not disappoint.  I loved this book and highly recommend the entire Fading series.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,4,False
563, . stars!  This is the perfect book to kick off your summer holiday reading!  The Mourning After was more than we expected and really delivers a sexy satisfying and entertaining story.  Georgia buys a beach house at the Carolina shore and plans to spend the summer renovating the house into a possible bed and breakfast.  She leaves Washington D.C.  and her longtime boyfriend Kyle.  At the beach she meets the very sexy Tristan and fights their attraction because of her relationship with Kyle.  This might sound a little predictable but its not.  Tristan makes her question whether she should sacrifice true love for the sake of others.  Georgia on the other hand is loyal to Kyle and believes love is not worth anything if you hurt others to be together.  I want to be with you.  I cant get you out of my head.  Of course Tristan is superhot and the story is full of MEGAsteamy scenes plus plenty of emotion.  Will Georgia stay with Kyle or will she follow her heart and let Tristan love her?  I want you all of you Georgia.  And I want you to want me too.  No spoilers but the title hints that a tragedy has occurred and the events surrounding this incident are explained near the end of the story.  This lifealtering event also sheds light on Georgias sometimesaggravating actions during the story.  In keeping with a discussion I had with one of my favorite authors at Book Bash I am keeping this review SHORT and TO THE POINT!  Did we like this book?  Yes!  Do we recommend it?  Yes!

564, ./ stars!  This book was a totally unexpected read!  As a fan of Tara Sivecs Chocolate Lovers series I was completely surprised by the very emotional tone of WATCH OVER ME.  The author takes you through every painful step of Addisons troubled journey in her attempts to recover from her mothers death as well as deal with her fathers alcohol addiction.  She must also bear the burden of managing her familys bakery business.  She struggles through each day and barely holds things together.  Addison then meets the wonderful Zander and it seems as if she is finally learning to work through her grief.  He accepts her unconditionally emotional problems and all.  Addison is also receiving counseling which seems to be helping her live a full and normal life.  Then the author throws in a few major plot twists which will totally surprise you!  The story caught me completely off guard and I absolutely loved the direction the author took with this book.  Do not read any reviews with spoilers its best if you read this book without knowing too much detail about the plot!  The cast of supporting characters is also very wellwritten and their presence really added to the storyline.

565, What a surprise!!   FANTASTiC COULDNTPUTITDOWN STARS!  Ill admit it.  Even though I am addicted to reading sometimes I get a little jaded...And then a book like Tangled comes along and BAM!  Just like that Im addicted to reading again.  Seriously a book that cites Braveheart the Borg an NYU sex study and frogs?  Im in.  Tangled is one of the most original books I have ever read.  Told from the main male character Drews POV the very talented author gives the reader a peek into how guys really feel and think:  Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy.  A fatty.  Morning wood.  Im sure theres some medical explanation for the phenomenon but I just like to think of it as a little present from God.  Drew is insanely attractive smart hardworking and very wealthy.  Sounds cliche right?  In the hands of this talented author Drew is one of the most memorable and original characters I have ever encountered!  I love Drews inner monologues.  They are both hysterically funny and very very touching.  Hes a selfconfessed womanizer who meets his match in the very smart and gorgeous Kate Brooks.  He falls hard for Kate and all his old rules about women and dating fly out the window.  Women fall in love quicker than men.  Easier and more often.  But when guys fall?  We go down harder.  And when things go bad?  When its not us who ends it?  We dont get to walk away.  We crawl.   The author has described the genre of Tangled as Comedic Erotica and Funny Smut.  Both phrases describe this book to a tee.  It is both hilarious and very very intense.  I started reading this book past midnight and did not want to put it down.  Seriously its that addictive.  Dont waste time reading this review.  Start reading Tangled.  You will absolutely fall in love with Drew!  ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.TangledEmma Chase,5,False

567, Gorgeouslywritten very sexy story!  Nina Lane continues to enchant and delight in the second book in the Spiral of Bliss series!  What can be said to add to the many star reviews for Allure other than to say it is a mustread?  The author has once again crafted a deeply erotic and romantic storyline that will keep you turning the pages well into the wee hours of the morning.  Allure picks up where Arouse left off.  Since there is a surprise at the end of Arouse I absolutely recommend that you read Arouse first.  Once again the author uses a dual POV that switches seamlessly between Olivia and Dean.  And once again Ms.  Lane knocks it out of the park with the sex scenes!  Just when you think you have read it all before along comes a book like Allure to show you just how stunningly beautiful erotica can be.  Allure reveals more about the development of Dean and Livs relationship told in flashbacks woven into the current story.  He was very careful with her in the beginning and always treated her as a treasure.  Be with me Liv he said.  Just be with me.  Liv fell hard for the professor despite the barriers she had erected to protect herself:  I was crazy about him.  I loved the way he invested everything with such purpose the way he focused his attention on me and really listened when I talked.  I move closer to him and tuck my face into the juncture of his shoulder.  Breathe in the scent of his skin.  Feel his heart beating against my palm.  Dean and Olivia must travel to California due to a family crisis and it is there that many of the crucial events in the book unfold.  We meet Deans family and Helen his former wife.  The author does an amazing job of introducing all of these characters and filling in Deans backstory.

Dean and Liv are deeply connected and very much in love but will their relationship be strong enough to withstand the several distressing events that occur in Allure?  There is an absolutely incredible storyline that will leave you wanting much much more.  I am anxiously awaiting the continuation of Dean and Livs story in Awaken.

Katy Evans has written Remy Tate as the ultimate passionate and raw Alpha male with Brooke as his willing and devoted woman.  I found Mine to be even more sensuallycharged than Real more sexual and more erotic.  Remy is hot he is hard and he is filled with love and protectiveness for Brooke.

572, I enjoyed the latest book in the Cut  Run series.  With that being said there is an awful lot going on in this book and the focus is not totally on Ty and Zane but is also shared by Nick and Kelly.  The story takes our group to Scotland for a wedding celebration.  Much mystery occurs with lots of action.  Of course my favorite parts of the book are the hot sexy times between Ty and Zane and the sometimes humorous banter between them.  Abigail Roux writes some deliciously steamy scenes and I wanted more more more!  All of the characters are welldeveloped and it seems like the focus might be on Nick and Kelly later.  If you like a lot of fastpaced action a good mystery and some really really hot Alpha guys then you will love Ball  Chain.  I absolutely love Abigail Rouxs wriritng style and look forward to reading many more of her books.  ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.,4,False

576, ArouseNina Lane   / blissful stars!  Finally an erotic novel where the marriage IS the story not just an epilogue  One day Im going to touch you in a thousand different ways and show you how to touch me he said.  And he did.  Struggling with a tormented past undergraduate Olivia Winter once led a practical but isolated life.  Then she met Professor Dean West a brilliant scholar of medieval history who melted Livs inhibitions and taught her the meaning of both love and erotic pleasure.  But after three years of a blissful lusty marriage Liv and Dean now face a crisis that threatens everything they believe about each other.  And when dark secrets and temptations rise to the surface the fallout might break them apart forever.  Nina Lane gives us two very relatable characters in Olivia and Dean.  Her writing is superb and the story kept me reading furiously until the end.  And did I mention that I am in love with Professor Dean West?  He is a totally hot alpha male who is also an intelligent and very wellrespected university professor.  Liv he said his voice rough with tenderness  you dont have to be afraid.  Why not?  Because Ill slay monsters for you.  Arouse gives us a candid peek into the inner workings of a onceperfect marriage between two somewhat damaged people.  Olivia had a troubled childhood which left her scarred in many ways.  Dean is her first love slightly older and very very sexy.  He literally sweeps her off her feet.  Something comes between them and they both must struggle with their own emotions as they deal with how these events will affect their marriage and their very tight bond.  I love him to my bones but suddenly Im wondering what I might have been without him.  I am not sure why the married couple theme has been mentioned as not being everyones cup of tea.  Olivia and Dean have an intense sexual relationship and Ms.  Lane knows how to write erotic scenes that will knock your socks off!  I also loved reading Deans POV after the midpoint of the book it was a refreshing switch and gave me a lot of insight into his behavior during the first part of the book.  Ill be here beauty.  Waiting for you.  This was my first book by Nina Lane.  I absolutely love her writing style.  Arouse is a brilliantlywritten look into the inner workings of a real relationship.  I LOVE Olivia and Dean and cant wait to dive right into Allure!,4,False

578,  Fantastical Stars!  What makes a hero is the one thats left standing when the others are dead.  Or the one that gave his life so the others could live.  Thats a fuckin hero.  Midnight Soul is the conclusion of the Fantasyland series with Noctorno Noc Hawthorne and Franka Drakkar who was truly evil in the previous books in this series.  But in trademark Kristen Ashley style Frankas true side is shown and all of her secrets are revealed.  She has endured terrible abuse for years to protect her brother and his family which she has hidden from everyone around her.  Not and Franka begin a very slowburn romance that at first begins as a friendship and partnership.  Kristen Ashley expertly weaves fantasy paranormal and reality with touches of comedy and as always a beautiful and enduring romance.  The scenes of Franka and others from her world being introduced to the modern world are funny and thoughtprovoking and always entertaining.  Noc sees the real Franka and his love transforms her.  I always tell friends who dont usually read fantasy that Kristen Ashleys books are magical and engrossing and Midnight Soul is no exception.  The journey that Franka takes is filled with forgiveness and redemption and yes a swoony Alpha who will stop at nothing to protect Franka and her loved ones.  Midnight Soul is an imaginative and sexy conclusion to the Fantasyland series.  It is filled with unforgettable characters and as always a magnificent Epilogue!

Jack is also very witty and totally HOT and is very much in love with the mucholder Grace.  The dark forces of stardom and fame start to pull Jack and Grace apart.  Her star is on the rise as he falls in with the wrong crowd and succumbs to the pressures of life in Hollywood.  I could not put this book down and absolutely loved Alice Claytons writing filled with wit warmth and SUPER steamy sex scenes!  This book is funny wellwritten and fastpaced.

582, Come to Me Quietly is the first book I have read by A.L.  Jackson and I absolutely loved it!  The author has written an exquisite story of second chances and the healing power of love.  The book switches back and forth between the present and the past and builds up a fantastic sense of foreboding that is sustained throughout the entire story.  Aly and Jared were inseparable as kids until a monumental event occurred that changed their lives forever.  Jared has now reunited with Aly and her older brother Christopher but he is the classic tortured bad boy full of pentup anger and unresolved feelings.  Aly cannot resist Jared and their scenes together are breathtaking.  They share a history together making their relationship all the more deeper and meaningful.  I loved how the pieces of this story were woven together coming together perfectly at the end into a wonderful conclusion.  Come to Me Quietly is a powerful impeccably written story filled with tremendous emotion tenderness and love.  A mustread!,5,False
583, A very sexy and emotional debut book from author Jessica Ingro!  Sams story drew me right in she really loved her husband Aiden but felt very disconnected from him due to their lack of intimacy.  The author does a great job describing the intense attraction between Sam and her old flame Jacob and the sex scenes in this book are incredibly hot and steamy.  Jacob is actually a very nice guy and there really are no bad people in this book unless you judge Sam for her unfaithfulness to her husband.  I did find some of her behavior towards the end of the book to be a little meanspirited but the author justifies Sams actions in the end.  All in all this is a very gripping very sexy and fairly fastpaced read and I loved the twists at the end.  A very creative way to conclude this story!  Stay tuned!  There will be more to come from these characters.,4,False
584, Breathtaking and ultimately beautiful.  This is NOT just a simple retelling of Hopeless!  Colleen Hoover once again weaves an emotionally powerful often painful and always beautiful story that you will not be able to put down.  Seeing the events of Hopeless from Holders point of view the reader is given insight into the circumstances surrounding certain tragic events from Hopeless and also into Holders actions in Hopeless.  This will be spoilerfree for those who have not yet read Hopeless and because this is being written prior to release day.  If you think there is nothing new that can be written about Holder and Skys story you are wrong!  Losing Hope is an incredibly sensitive and very sexy!  book written by a masterful storyteller.  Ms.  Hoover has actually made me fall more in love with Holder than I already was!  Theyre so perfect I say.  Like hearts.  I could literally stare at your lips for days and never get bored.   Holder  You will be emotionally drained after reading Losing Hope but it feels oh so good.  Make no mistake this is a heartwrenching story.  But there are no extraneous characters in this story and no weak plot points.  Every character and every event is perfectly meaningful and necessary.  My attention is constantly homed in on her like Im a compass and shes my North.   Holder  You should definitely read Hopeless first because it is amazing story.  With that being said you will love Losing Hope if you are a fan of Hopeless because it is a passionate fresh and lyrical story.  Enjoy.,5,False

She focuses her attention on Javier as part of her scheme but she most certainly does not plan on falling in love.  Simple story right?  In the hands of Karina Halle it becomes a rich story of lust of love and loss sin and redemption and trust and betrayal.  Ellie thinks she is control of her emotions but she falls fast and hard for Javier and who wouldnt?  He is handsome protective and worships Ellie.  He is also a member of a violent drug cartel.

588, . stars!  Step outside your comfort zone and take a trip to Sector Four with The Beyond series by Kit Rocha.  I never imagined a dystopic series could be so gripping erotic gritty and thoroughly surprising as these books by Kit Rocha.  Although the authors tried to create a standalone with Beyond Jealousy and it definitely can be read on its own you will miss the rich background stories on the other characters in this book and I recommend picking this series up from the beginning.  Ace Rachel and Cruz are the heart of BEYOND JEALOUSY and we are treated to a SIZZLING menage between these three very different and stubborn characters.  I have always said you dont know Alpha until you meet an OKane and Cruz and Ace are no exceptions.  This is a world of graphic sex unbridled pleasure strong women and freeflowing booze.  This is a surprisingly emotional story as we get to delve into the insecurities and passions forming this incredible threesome.  Kit Rocha writes some of the most intense erotic and steamy sex scenes I have ever read and BEYOND JEALOUSY is no exception!  Rachel Cruz and Ace form one memorable menage that I will not soon forget!  It wouldnt be a fdup triangle if they met in the middle.  It would be straightup fg.  These three really care about each other and that forms the heart of the story.  I highly recommend BEYOND JEALOUSY as well as the entire BEYOND series.

Beyond Shame might be the most sexually charged book I have ever read and I loved every minute.  Noelles discovery that she can be totally free sexually and otherwise in Sector Four makes for some thrilling reading.  Beyond Shame is like a Kristen Ashley story on crack.  The men are hot they are sexy and the sex scenes are like nothing I have ever read.  Even getting inked turns into an erotic experience for Noelle.  Loved the dystopic storyline and that the female characters are free to make their own choices.  Jasper and Noelle are unforgettable characters.

591, If you like your writing fueled by a little testosterone then Karina Halles The Artist Trilogy series is for you.  Before you read any further you MUST first read Sins  Needles Book  or the novella On Every Street before Shooting Scars.  Both books provide a rich and detailed look into the minds and motivations of the three main characters Ellie Camden and Javier.  With that said buckle up because Shooting Scars is one hell of a ride.  Shooting Scars plunges back into the action right where Sins  Needles ended.  Ellie and Camden are thrown into an impossible situation which leaves Ellie back with Javier the former love of her life.  Does she hate him?  Does she love him?  All is revealed in painfully beautiful detail in Shooting Scars.  Ellie Cam and Javier are all incredibly complicated characters.  What I love about Karina Halles writing is that there is no black and white no good or evil no angels or demons in my opinion.  Each character has their own complex motivations for their behavior and Karina refreshingly lets the reader form their own opinions about the characters.  I dont want to describe the plot in detail here because Shooting Scars is a very intricate tale that is best enjoyed fresh.  Shooting Scars is filled with lots of action romance and twists and turns.  Is it painful?  Hell yes.  And that is why it is such an amazing story.  My problem?  I need Bold Tricks like yesterday.

592, Kristen Ashley is my favorite author.  Her books make my heart pound get my pulse racing make me cry make me laugh and wrap me always in a cocoon of family friendship and love.  Could you ask anything more from a writer?  And Wild And Free the third installment in the Three Series does all of that and much much more.  Wild and Free contains some of the rawest animalistic sensual and gorgeous love scenes I have ever read.  Abel and Lilah destined to be mates for life need to be able to draw you in to their characters and their fated mating for this to be a believable story.  And boy do they ever!  Just when I think Ms.  Ashley could not possibly create a more Alpha male than she already has she writes Abel who is a hybrid and who mates like nobodys business!  This book contains everything you could possibly hope for in a paranormal romance.  There is incredible heartstopping action hot sex otherwordly beings superhot sex wolves vampires and heartpounding sex!  I absolutely loved Abel and his story broke my heart.  Lilah is a kickass heroine brave uninhibited sexual.  loyal and loving.  These two together just might save the world.  I could not put this book down and was literally swooning at every page.  Even if you are not a big fan of paranormal romance and I do not read a lot of them Wild And Free is a MUSTREAD.  This book is truly Kristen Ashley at her finest.  She is not afraid to pull the punches and make sacrifices when they work for the story.  And for that I love her.  Be prepared to be wowed.

596, I was thrilled when Sylvain Reynard announced that there would be a final book in the Gabriels Inferno Series.  I could not get enough of Gabriel and Julianne and reread both Gabriels Inferno and Gabriels Rapture several times when they were first released.  Gabriels Redemption the third book in the series is immensely satisfying and stunningly written.  Even descriptions of simple acts such as eating or studying take on rich and layered meanings when written by Sylvain Reynard.  And the love scenes between Gabriel and his beloved Julia took my breath away.  In the months since their marriage their desire had not abated nor had the sweetness of their coupling.  All speech melted into motion and touch and the bliss of physical love.  This story takes place shortly after their marriage and shows the struggles that Gabriel and Julia  like most couples  must go through while building a life together.  Will Gabriel overcome the guilt he feels about his past?  Will Julia be able to reconcile Gabriels burning desire to start a family with her own educational ambitions?  She too feels guilt and conflicting emotions over Gabriels plans for their future together.  Gabriel was a consuming fire.  His passion his desires all seemed to overtake the desires of those around him.  Hed told her once that she was the only woman whod ever said no to him.  He was probably correct.  Sylvain Reynard weaves in many Old Testament references which enrich the love story between Gabriel and Julia.  Nicely balanced with the heavy themes of love forgiveness and redemption are the funny comments by the Snarky Narrator which lend an air of levity to the book.  The secondary characters that I love also make appearances in this book.  Professor Picton is a strong influence on Julia and helps to guide her in making certain lifealtering decisions including dealing with the evil Christa who is still out to make trouble for the Emersons.  We also see a glimpse into Paul Norris life and the dangerous Simon and Natalie also make appearances.  Gabriels devotion to Julia remains unwavering and I loved reading their scenes together.  He still battles with feelings of inadequacy but Julias goodness helps him overcome his deepseated feelings of guilt and selfloathing.  Almost six months into their marriage he loved her more than before he envied the very air she breathed.  I also loved the way in which Julia grew as a person in this book and became much stronger in her educational studies and in dealing with her professors and others who conspire against her.  She also stands up to Gabriel who is certainly a force to be reckoned with.  Gabriel too grows as a person as he uncovers facts about his past that help him find closure to certain events in his life and bring him some measure of peace.  I suppose were all on our own spiritual journeys.  Some of us are further along than others.  Sylvain Reynard did a spectacular job of concluding Julia and Gabriels story in this book.  Once again Sylvain delivers a richly detailed and deeplyfelt story that will stay with you long after you finish the last word.  I was sobbing at the sheer beauty of this book and cant wait to read more from Sylvain Reynard.  ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

She and Scott and very drawn to each other and Emma tries to fight her intense attraction to him.  Scott is a HOT musician but has a very sweet and loving side to him.  This is not your typical YA book and contains some very emotional angsty scenes and some very thrilling sex between Emma and Scott.  Definitely a sequel coming based on the ending.  I like the authors writing style but found myself yelling at Emma throughout the book due to her constant pulling away from Scott!  Looking forward to more from this author.

James is sexy gorgeous tattooed and everything that Tate thinks she needs to run away from.  But wouldnt you know it James is SEXY and LOVING and he waits patiently sort of for Tate to come to her senses.  Tate and James meet cute in a Florida retirement community and agree they will get together JUST for sex.  But they fall hard for each other and Tate runs scared.  This book had elements of Kristen Ashley which I loved.  Intense sexual attraction HOT ALPHA MALE who wants to protect his woman and a storyline that leaves Tate in danger.  This book is about two people with serious relationship issues and ultimately a story about heartbreak healing and trust.  This book is VERY EXPLICIT and the sex scenes are TOTALLY HOT.  James is intense controlling and I loved every minute.  James  I highlighted so many passages in this book but here are some of my favorites:  When he regained his senses his throat felt raw his mind foggy and he wasnt sure if his legs would work againever.  What the fuck had happened?  Had she killed him?   James  He felt feverish out of control famished like hed been waiting for this for ages.  There werent going to be any fancy moves from him.

600, Beauty From PainGeorgia Cates  UNEXPECTED  STAR READ  Very few books draw me in like Up in the Air All In Gabriels Inferno Bared To You etc. but this book did.  After reading This Man earlier in January it was hard to find characters and a storyline that would keep me up all night but thanks to Georgia Cates I now have Laurelyn and Jack.  This story had me riveted from the first page when Jack proposes an unusual arrangement to Laurelyn upon her arrival for a  month summer visit to Australia.  She accepts and they embark on a HOT relationship.  I wont call it a romance because neither one agrees to that at least at first.  I loved the Australian setting but I will admit I had to look up a few slang words.  Sanger sandwich  Oldies  parents  Coldie  beer  Brekkie  breakfast  Favorite quotes:  You treat me like Im somebody instead of a nobody.  Ive been wanting to devour this mouth since the first time I saw you.  Jack you dont always know the true worth of a womans love until it becomes a memory.  There is a cliffhanger ending of course but the author treats us to a delicious Prologue.  The sex between Jack and Laurelyn is super HOT but I really felt a connection between the two thanks to Ms.  Cates writing.  More Jack please!  And make it quick!,5,False

Kacey has sacrificed her own dreams of college to take care of her younger sister and put her through high school.  They move into an apartment complex with a cast of characters including wonderful new friends and one gorgeous neighbor Trent Emerson.  Kacey tries to numb her emotions and tries to push everyone away who cares about her.  I absolutely loved how this story unfolded and I found myself really rooting for Kacey to overcome her past tragedy and let her emotions in!  There is FANTASTIC chemistry between Kacey and Trent.  I also loved the other characters especially Kaceys little sister Livie.  A wonderfully written book that does not disappoint.Ten Tiny BreathsK.A.  Tucker,5,False

I wish I could do justice to this book but I am not eloquent enough.  This is a stunning story that will break your heart thrill you and leave you wanting much much more.  It is difficult to write a review of this book without giving away any of the major plot twists.  Karina Halle is a very gifted storyteller with an incredibly sensitive voice.  I stayed up very very late to finish this book.  I could not wait to see what path Ellie and Camden would take.  And oh yeah there is some very graphic and steamy sex.  It is very gratifying to find an author who can surprise and thrill with such a great story.

603, SYNOPSIS  Hanna Boudreaux has lived in the small town of Willow all her life.  Shes sweet cute and quiet.  Hanna has a moment of epiphany when she realizes her crush for forever Raiden Ulysses Miller is not ever going to be hers.  She sees her life as narrow and decides to do something about it.  Raiden Miller is the towns local hero.  A former Marine with the medal to prove his hero status he comes home shrouded in mystery.  It takes a while but eventually Hanna catches his eye.  After all these years of Raid and Hanna living in the same town the question is why?  Is Raid interested in Hanna because shes sweet and cute?  Or does Raid have something else going on?  OUR REVIEW  We have had a love affair with all things Kristen Ashley since we first read Knight last year.  Yes Knight was our first foray into Kits world and we have never looked back.  We have read almost every single one of Ms.  Ashleys books.  Each of her series are highly recommended.  Our blog is new so we have not posted all of our reviews yet but we can discuss each character at length and yes we have read every Rock Chick book.  You can imagine our excitement when we were selected to receive an ARC of RAID.  We could not believe it!  Who can resist a book that even had us highlighting the Authors Note?  I have many hearts desires and one of them is the slim chance that my books will guide women to accepting themselves as they are having confidence in their bodies brains and beauty and letting all that poison go so they can enjoy their lives including sexually.  ROCK ON KRISTEN!  We would like to think that there is a litte bit of Ms.  Ashley in the character of Hanna.  She is sweet she is cute she is trusting she has a cat she handknits afghans for a living and she lives in a small town.  She has been crushing on Raiden Miller since she was a young girl.  When he returns to town a war hero and he finally notices her her whole world is turned upside down.  Of course this would not be a proper Unfinished Hero book without a lot of danger a lot of graphic sex and one HOT ALPHA MALE.  You get all that and more with RAID.  We confess that we reread KNIGHT and CREED in one day while in the middle of reading RAID.  Favorite Quotes:  Prefer to be with a woman whos cute and shy and obviously into me.  Means I can save time and get straight to shit that matters.   Raid  Id crawled across a room for Raiden Miller.  And it was him not me who stopped it because I didnt like it.  Which made me look back and like it.   Hanna  Hanna is Raids reward.  We loved this book and would have loved a little more interaction with the other unfinished heroes who appear in this story this is a standalone book but you should read KNIGHT and CREED in that order.  With that said where can we find us a Raiden Ulysses Miller?  RaidKristen Ashley,5,False

Everything we absolutely love about the Rock Chick series is packed right into the last installment: gorgeous real women hot Alpha heroes and SUPER hot sex!

I dont fight fair baby.  I fight to win.  And not one of them looked like you look when I slide inside you every fucking time I slide inside you.  Like a piece of you has been lost and now its found.  Ally and Ren are TOTALLY hot together!  And the storyline is pure Kristen Ashley pure emotion lots of action some danger a few misunderstandings but above all lots of strong hot men and lots of strong gorgeous women!  All of our beloved characters make an appearance in Rock Chick Revolution and theres even a very familiar name coughcough thrown around.  I laughed a lot and I started crying at the introduction.  The road to Ally and Rens HEA was a bumpy one but of course it ends in pure beauty and perfection as only KA can do:  Because when I had to be a badass all day and cases got tough and I came home or when life just sucked or when life was awesome and going along fine I knew this was what Ren Zano would give me.

607, Stunning emotional book.  Completely surprising read.  Please dont shy away from this book due to the wartime setting.  Wounded is an emotional satisfying story of two souls brought together by the harsh realities of war.  Rania is a beautiful Iraqi woman who had to resort to prostitution at a very young age in order to simply survive.  She is shut down emotionally until by chance she meets Hunter an American fighting in Iraq.  They cannot communicate at first due to the language barrier but learn to communicate in other ways.  He is asleep.  So handsome.  I do not understand what is happening to me.  From the first moment I saw him something in him called to my blood and made it sing.   Rania  Ms.  Wilder delivers some very lush and explicit sex scenes between Rania and Hunter which were an unexpected surprise.  Rania.  Her name is music.  Her eyes are veiled pools of expression.  She hides behind anger behind toughness.  Its all an act.  I see the pain.  See the fear.  See the need.  Shes lonely.  She hates what she does.    Hunter  The author is a gifted writer with a a sensitive voice.  Wounded is not filled with lighthearted scenes but it is ultimately a story of love and understanding that will leave you fulfilled at the end.,5,False
608, If you want a completely suprising and enthralling read this book is for you.  Reapers Property is a SCORCHING romance with a super hot biker named Horse.  And yes his nickname does refer to a certain part of the male anatomy!  We usually dont give a synopsis in our short and sweet book reviews but just by way of background Marie has fallen on hard times and is trying for a fresh start by moving in with her loser brother Jeff.  Through a series of incidences told through flashbacks which we loved by the way Marie is taken as collateral by Horse a member of the Reapers Motorcycle Club.  There is a lot more to Horse than his badass persona.  We really loved how Ms.  Wylde describes the inner workings of a MC.  Not sure if its all accurate but boy is it interesting!  They have their own code of ethics and do not operate like the rest of the civilian world.  This is a rough book and um its not exactly a traditional romance.  Who knew there was such a distinction between a sweet butt and an old lady!  All we can say is BRAVO to Ms.  Wylde for creating one of the most memorable badass alphas out there.  fans self We cant wait to read more Reapers MC!  Reapers PropertyJoanna Wylde,5,False

612, Imagine my pleasant surprise when I ended up with an ARC of Walking Disaster.  I was even more surprised to be immediately drawn inside the sensitive loving and intense head of Travis Mad Dog Maddox.  Walking Disaster contains no surprise story lines it is the story of Beautiful Disaster told from the POV of Travis.  You do not need to have read Beautiful Disaster first but I highly recommend that you do in order to understand some of the nuances of the story and the characters.  Travis is loving he is sexy he is kind he is sensitive and he is very very caring.  Yes its true!  Jamie McGuire has created a wonderful caring male character who will become the new book boyfriend to lots of fans.  Travis and his family lost their beloved mother at a young age.  Her last words to Travis were One of these days youre going to fall in love son.  Dont settle for just anyone.  Choose the girl that doesnt come easy the one you have to fight for and then never stop fighting.  Never stop fighting for what you want.  These words serve Travis well when he meets his match in Abby Pidge Abernathy.  Travis knows immediately that Abby is very different from the endless parade of girls that he has been with.  He is aware of his badboy reputation but in his mind he has always been nothing but totally honest with every girl he has ever been with:  She was my opposite: innocent on the surface and damaged deep within.  I was a little frustrated at Abbys stubbornness in constantly pushing Travis away emotionally and physically but smart and sexyass Travis takes his mothers advice and fights hard for Abby!  I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.  It turns out it wasnt something about you at all.  It was just you.  I love a book with an alternate POV so Walking Disaster fit the bill for me.  I enjoyed reading the Las Vegas and fighting scenes from Travis POV.  You will not believe what an intelligent caring and loyal character Travis is.  Finally the author also treats us to a wonderfully surprising and satisfying Epilogue that I can only hope will lead to much more Travis and Abby!  Walking DisasterJamie McGuire,5,False
613, CollideGail McHugh  This book has haunted me since I finished.  Emily Gavin and Dillon really got under my skin.  I so wanted for Emily to leave her boyfriend Dillon and be with Gavin with whom she felt an instant attraction the moment they met.  But she felt bound to Dillon and he uses every narcissistic trick in the book to keep her.  Emilys confusion over her feelings for Dillon are at first understandable  he did help her through some very tough times  but then I found myself yelling at her to leave Dillon and be with Gavin!  The sex scenes I this book are really really hot but I wish there had been more!  I dont want to give away any spoilers but I did enjoy catching a glimpse into what a relationship with a true narcissist might be like .  My heart broke a few times during this book it was a much darker read than I originally expected.  There is a doozy of a cliffhanger and I cant wait to see how this story concludes.  Oh and by the way Gavin Blake is HOT and is a new favorite book boyfriend!,4,False

616, Beautiful BastardChristina Lauren  LOVED THIS BOOK.  Holy hell the sex is hot!  It comes early it comes fast and it comes HARD.  Pun intended.  Its interesting that some reviewers looked at this as a negative but the fact that Chloe and Bennett have sex almost at the beginning of this book is very much a part of the narrative.  They then work backwards and develop their relationship and emotional connection from there.  I couldnt put this book down.  I might be one of the three people in the world who did not read The Office but apparently there are some major differences between the original Twilight fanfic and Beautiful Bastard.  I loved how Bennett and Chloe were loved and respected by everyone else but they could not seem tone be civil towards at each other.  Also loved the back and forth POVs between the two characters.  This book is not for everyone but it is a treat worth reading.  I cant wait for more of Bennett and Chloe!  ARC provided courtesy of NetGalley.,5,False
617, We loved his book!  There is a menage and explicit BDSM involved so this story might not be for everyone.  Ms.  Dalton does a wonderful job of developing the the main characters Kade Leah and Seth and exploring the the deepening relationship between the three.  There is explicit D/s scening so be warned.  And the sex scenes are STEAMY.  Sequel for Tony?  Pretty please?,5,False
618, Its difficult to write a review of a book that ends one of my favorite series ever.  Did I want Olivia and Calebs story to end?  Absolutely not.  I have been obsessed with these characters ever since I first read The Opportunist.  Was I satisfied with the conclusion?  Completely!  Tarryn Fisher does not give her readers hearts flowers and rainbows she gives flaws secrets and twisted emotions.  You have been warned.  I absolutely love a male POV and Tarryn really delivers in Thief.  The first two books in this series The Opportunist and Dirty Red are absolute mustreads before Thief and the entire series belongs on your immediate toread list.  A perfect star story.,5,False
619, You will yell at the characters and also shed a tear or too!  We thought we despised Leah but to the authors credit Ms.  Fisher does a fabulous job of telling Leahs backstory.  And she does disappoint.  We do not like to give away any spoilers but trust us when we say that you will be shocked saddened and stunned by this book!  Oh Caleb!  We still love you!  Cant wait for Thief!,5,False
620, WOW what a surprising book!  Fabulous story and characters and we could NOT put this one down.  These are not your usual cast of characters they make terrible mistakes and some are filled with anger and dishonesty!  We love love love Caleb.

623,  out of  stars to The Stranger Just One Night!  The Stranger is very sexy and suspenseful.  I read it in just one night pun intended.  I was expecting a carbon copy of Fifty Shades or Bared to You but this book is different.  The book is told from the POV of Kasie who has a fling in Las Vegas with a very handsome stranger.  Circumstances later bring them together again which leads to Kasie being torn between being a.  good girl or following her heart.  This book includes some very steamy sex scenes and one very hot guy Mr Dade.  I cant wait to learn more about him in the next book because this one is told from Kasies POV and ends rather abruptly on a huge cliffhanger.  Kasies actions might disturb some readers because you are told from the beginning that she has a boyfriend but I felt the author did a good job of explaining Kasies thought process.

625, . stars!!  Poughkeepsie is one of my favorite books a beautiful romantic and yes sometimes violent story of true love loyalty goodness and family.  It is a mustread and the kind of book and characters that stay with you forever.  So when I heard that Debra Anastasia planned to write a second book about Beckett Taylor I could not wait to read it!  Beckett is violent damaged loving loyal and sexy  in short my favorite kind of anti hero.  Beckett is in love with the equallydamaged Eve and Return to Poughkeepsie is their story.  Beckett is admittedly the scariest motherfucker in Poughkeespie.  He makes a decision early in this book that breaks the hearts of all those who love him.  Eve is the love of his life and um they have some incredible chemistry:  Youre mine now.  You gave up.  Know that you could have killed me.  Now nothing will stop me.  Despite their love for each other Beckett feels that he must redeem himself as a person and become a man worthy of Eve and his familys love.  No real spoilers here but the author then takes us on a wild ride for the rest of the story filled with incredibly memorable characters hello handsome cop!   very twisted criminals and tender and heartbreaking family scenes.  My loves Blake and Livia are prominent in this book as are Cole and Kyle.  But the focus of the story is on Beckett and his love Eve.  Eve is one kickass heroine and she really holds her own throughout this story.  Although I absolutely loved her scenes with Beckett I also really loved Ryan the very sexy Poughkeepsie cop who in another lifetime could have been someone Eve fell for.  Could there be a spinoff here?  Hmmm lets hope so!  Eve becomes involved in a very complicated crime scheme that ultimately involves the entire clan and leads to some real nailbiting scenes.  I was really rooting for Beckett and Eve and was thrilled at the conclusion to their story.  Although Beckett has changed somewhat in this book from Book  he is still the same loyal tough mean and sexy SOB as he was in Poughkeepsie.  But its his scenes with Eve that I loved most.  Eve was magnificent.  Every damn time.  Return to Poughkeepsie is a very substantial book filled with sexy funny tender and dramatic moments.  There are some heartbreaking story lines and some incredibly sexy and violent ones too.  I absolutely savored every single word of this story and was saddened to see it end.  A fantastic sequel to one of my alltime favorite books.  ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.,5,False

They move into an apartment complex with a cast of characters including wonderful new friends and one gorgeous neighbor Trent Emerson.  Kacey tries to numb her emotions and tries to push everyone away who cares about her.  I absolutely loved how this story unfolded and I. found myself really rooting for Kacey to overcome her past tragedy and.  let her emotions in!  There is FANTASTIC chemistry between Kacey and Trent.

629, I was thrilled to be able to read this super sexy continuation of Rebecca Masons journey with her Master.  Rebecca will belong completely to her new Master once she signs the contract he has given her which sets the terms of their Master/sub relationship.  Will Rebecca give him her ultimate trust?  In this steamy novella her Master consumes her body and soul even as he explores her limits:  ...I will push you to your limit Rebecca but I will always leave you thoroughly pleasured.  Rebecca tries not to lose herself but she is intoxicated by her Master.  He is sexy irresistible and powerful and I wanted to read more about him.  Who is he?  What happened to Rebecca?  There is a hint here as to her Masters identity and these journals are mustreads for fans of the Inside Out series.  Plus you get a sneak peek into Being Me!

630, WHAT HAPPENED TO REBECCA?  I know its odd to give  stars to what is essentially a novella but this to me is an essential part of the Inside Out series of which If I Were You is one of our alltime favorite books!

There are subtle hints as to who the wouldbe Master might be.  This is a very short but very very satisfying read.  Cant wait for the next installment of Rebeccas lost journals.

632, Can we give this book  stars?  We actually read this book at slower than usual because we did NOT want it to end!  Cathy: I loved this book!  I absolutely love that Jesse is obsessive and controlling with Ava but still very very loving.  I didnt get much sleep because I couldnt stop reading.  I also loved that it picked up shortly after This Man so it flowed perfectly.  This book took you to another level of Jesse and Avas relationship.  I dont want to give away any spoilers but one of my favorite parts of the book is when Jesse tells Ava SHE is the one who holds the power.  Swoon  Ellen: I love how Ava constantly pushed Jesse.  And the scene near the end of the book when she was trying to make her point to Jesse... OMG!  She is in love with Jesse but she feels very insecure.  Jodi Ellen Malpas has written a sexy shocking and surprising book!  We dont want to give away any spoilers and we assume everyone has read This Man.  Beneath This Man picks up a few days after This Man ends.  This book is is VERY hot and the sex scenes are AMAZING.  Much of the tension in the story revolves around an anniversary party for the Manor that Ava does not want to attend.  There are a LOT of surprises and the end does not disappoint!  Oh and there is one really spiteful character named Sarah!  Jesse fire her!  You will fall in love with Jesse Ward.  We cant wait for the third book This Man Confessed.  My work here is done.

634, I am simply speechless.  One of the best books Ive ever read.  Where did Katja Millay go?  She needs to write another book!  A moving story about second chances and the power of unconditional love.  TSoT should be read by everyone.  True story: Several years ago I was planning my attendance at my very first book signing ever.  A lovely reader from SLOVENIA yes you read that correctly messaged me and asked if I could please try and get a copy of TSoT signed for her by Katja Millay.  Of course I said I would certainly try.  I thought to myself.  wow this book must really be something special!  And so I bought the book and there it sat on my Kindle since .  Yes I met the author she was absolutely lovely but I did not fangirl over her because I had not yet read this treasure of a book!!!  And now she seems to have disappeared!!  GAAHHHHHH!!  I need a dover!  If you are like me you probably have tons of books sitting on your ereader and maybe even on your bookshelf unread for whatever reason.  I made a resolution that this year I would slow down on taking ARCs and get through all of the wonderful books that I have been meaning to get to for years.  Well TSoT is now one of my alltime favorite books.  I cant stop thinking about it.  The author has a special gift with the written word and I just want to shout from the rooftops about this treasure!  My name is Nastya Kashnikov.  I was a pianoplaying prodigy who doesnt belong anywhere near an Intro to Music class.  I was murdered two and a half years ago.  Discuss.  Nastya is starting high school at a new school where she looks and feels and acts like the outsider that she is.  She pushes everyone away with her special brand of toughness AND she also refuses to speak.  At all.  What happened to this girl that has made her so withdrawn from her family and everyone around her?  I live in a world without magic or miracles.  A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters no angels or superhuman boys to save you.  A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck.  Besides getting the feel and all the angst of high school EXACTLY right the author slowly reveals what has made Nastya into the girl she is today.  But if Nastya thinks she has the selfpity market cornered shes got nothing on Josh Bennett another loner who has had the most terrible tragedies happen to him.  Josh is also unapproachable but he becomes fascinated by this girl who wears allblack every single day and acts angry all the time.  She does look like a badass.  Ive seen her arms and shes ripped which is kind of weird and scary all at once because it just seems all wrong on her.  Shes really small and fragilelooking and at the same time its like shes some exotic teenage mercenary all rock solid dressed in black ready to take somebody down.  None of it makes any sense.  Its kind of disconcerting.  Shes like an optical illusion.  You look at it from one angle and you see the picture and you think youve got a lock on it and then it shifts and the image changes to something entirely different and you cant even find the original picture anymore.  Its a serious mindfuck.  Nastya is an enigma.  Her story gradually begins to unfold and it is extremely unsettling and almost unbearable.  For all of her toughness she is extremely fragile and vulnerable but eventually begins to let others in.  Just a little.  I havent said a word to another living person in  days.  I write my three and a half pages tuck away my composition book and crawl into bed knowing how close I came to not making it to .  Let me just say two words about this book: Josh Bennett.  He is sensitive intelligent and loyal.  He realizes how fragile Nastya is.  I adore him!  He doesnt know why she is so closed off to the world but he very carefully begins to crack her shell little by little.  But the more she gives me the more abstract she gets.  Its like pieces to three different puzzles.  You try to put them together but they never fit and when you force them the picture comes out all wrong.  Despite her resolution never to let someone love her Nastya begins to get close to Josh and his very small circle of old friends.  Their relationship unfolds very slowly but they just seem to understand each other.  She still keeps secrets from him but she begins to trust him absolutely.  Josh Bennett laughs and for one minute everything is right in the world.  Josh is Nastyas lifeline.  As her carefully constructed world begins to fall apart Josh is there for her.  Until she pushes him away.  I honestly did not know whether or not the author was going to give these two the happy ending they both so desperately deserved but the ending was PERFECT.  I almost stopped breathing during the last  of this book.  Nastya is so pessimistic about her future that nothing about this book would have surprised me.  People like Josh Bennett and I dont get perfect.  Most of the time we dont even get remotely tolerable.  And thats why it scares me.  Because even if there was such a thing to begin with perfect never lasts.  This book actually has some light moments and very funny scenes mixed in with all the angst.  They were a welcome relief from the heaviness and were done just right.  All of the supporting characters were absolutely perfect and I pray for another book soon from Katya Millay.  If you havent read this book yet dont wait.  It is truly a treasure.  Every day you save me.,5,False

640, Break Her is one of those books that I am really not qualified to review because the writing is so amazing Clue  as to the authors identity!  so Ill just stick to giving my humble opinion.  I read this book a few months ago and have been thinking about it ever since.  To me that is the hallmark of an excellent book.  Here is the synopsis of the story in which a woman wakes to find a dangerous stranger in her bed:  Now your home has become your prison and your body a battlefield.  How would you hold onto your sanity your selfesteem your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three?  In the psychological thriller Break Her one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before.  On the surface this intruder has all the advantages: strength weapons ruthlessness.  The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level.  The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies shes told herself the hard shell of indifference shes hidden in and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her years ago.   Break Her is a very graphic story of the gripping psychological interplay between the woman and the rapist.  I refuse to call her simply Victim as some reviewers have done.  The rapist is very cunning and very strong.  He is determined to destroy the woman not only physically but emotionally as well.  He was decent looking.  He probably had money.  He could have sex any way he wanted any time he wanted.  But he liked it this way.  The story itself is set over a period of an excruciating day and a half within the physical confines of a house.  The characters are not named by the author.  Through a series of flashbacks however the womans past is explained in detail and other characters are introduced.  I was hanging on every word and reading furiously to reach the stunning conclusion of this book.  You think youll wear me out he hissed not using a question.  You think youll eventually satisfy me and reach the end of this.  But everything you do makes me want you more deeper impossibly more.  I think Im reaching a point Ive never hit before.  Like perpetual motion.  Or nirvana.  Ill never stop.  There are many questions raised by this story.  What was the author trying to convey here?  Well first and foremost I think it is a story of the womans fierce strength and will to survive.  The author has written this book under a pseudonym so that we do not know the writers gender.  Brilliant.  The author has ventured an opinion on the subject of rape in other forums that forgiveness allows rape victims to move on and to separate themselves from what happened.  The author has also questioned why rape is the only crime that seems to be an open wound which gives men a huge amount of power to know that by this one act they can potentially destroy a woman.  Certainly the woman in Break Her does not accept the definition of rape as an open wound and in that sense this book is very empowering.  Break Her is an incredibly gripping and yes emotionally exhausting story.  It is very thoughtprovoking and will make you question what values you believe in.  I could not put this book down.  I can only hope that the author chooses to continue the womans story because I need more of this story.Break HerB.G.  Harlen,5,False

651, Never in a million years did I think I would love a book about a parallel world with elves kings magic...but this is Kristen Ashley after all so I fell in love with this book!!  I was enthralled by this story and felt transported to this world that Ms.  Ashley created.  In search of an epic adventure Finnie trades places with her twin who lives in a parallel universe.  Immediately she is swept off to marry the king in an arranged marriage.  He then leaves her alone in the middle of the woods and so begins this epic tale that had me swooning at every word.  Frey Drakkar is ubersexy controlling and at first noncommunicative.  But slowly these two develop a bond that is beautiful and lasting and quite magical.  I am not a huge reader of fantasy but this book is quite simply unforgettable.  The characters came alive for me and the story is amazing.  Even if you are not a fan of this genre read this book!!

665, Destroyed  By: Pepper Winters Goodreads Author    Killing Stars  Give me a second to fully digest everything I just read....umm... WOW ... there are no words to describe how this book made me feel.  The tragic story of Roan Fox was simply the most heartbreaking thing ever.  So when reading this book make sure to prepare your hear grab a box of tissues and be prepared to cry your eyes out.  The moment I set eyes on her I tasted a delicious combination of fear and strength.  Weakness and bravery sadness and resignation.  Instincts and needs that Id buried and ignored volcanoes to the surface.  I lost control.  I broke every rule and I didnt give a fuck.  She woke a part of me I didnt know existed layered in ice and cold blooded disassociation.  Roan Fox is a tortured soul who has lived a horrible life at the hands of the worse kind of people who kidnapped and held him captive since he was six years old.  He was beaten and tortured into conditioning to doing everything and anything they wanted including kill.   No one would look at me and think I was slave.  But I had been.  I still was.  I probably would be forever.  Once he finally escapes he begins to live as a zombie version of himself unable to touch or be touch unable to please or be pleased simply miserable living a life void of emotions and filled with fear.  That is until he meets Hazel Hunter and his miserable life changes forever.  Ill give you two hundred thousand for one month of pure access.  I want to buy your obedience your body your mind.  But most of all I want to buy your secrets.   Tonight I did the one thing that made least sense of all.  I bought a girl.  And I would never let her go.  Top rule.  Unbreakable rule.  Dont.  Ever.  Touch.  Me.  He begins to fight all his conditioning instincts to be a normal man for her.  But as with everything in his life nothing is ever that easy.  The road to normalcy is not as easy as he thought it would be after only one look into Zels eyes at his club.   Youre Mine and I refuse to live without you.  The battle with his own personal demons wasnt so easily won.  He has to challenge himself again and again with fear of losing the only people he loves.  Obey or Ill kill you.  Im here for you for her.  Forever if youll have me.  Just pleaseforgive me.  Hazel Zel is a strong courageous woman who fights with teeth and nail to save those she loves most.  She instantly feels the connection between her and Fox and gives up herself in order to try to help him find his cure to his conditioning without losing her life along the way.  But her secret can kill them both...   No Im not okay.  Everything about you tells me to run yet I ignore myself and end up getting hurt again.  I find myself needing to help othersits a compulsion driving me insane.   You mistreat me and Ill make you dickless for the rest of your life.  Treat me with respect and desire and Ill stay.  I accept your offer Obsidian Fox.  Dont make me regret it.   With fear and stupidity I sold myself to him.  Sold myself to a fighter who could sense my lies as easily as a fox senses a rabbit.  I regretted it.  I reveled in it.  It destroyed me.  Meanwhile she is also trying to save the life of the one person she loves most and she is afraid that in the end she will end losing them both.  The life of her daughter the life of the one person who has the ability to change everything.  A child was my cure.  The daughter of the woman I tried to kill.  It was time to face my past full of darkness and say fuck you.  It was time to start new memories.  Her touch shattered me.  Her touch awoke me.  Her touch destroyed me.  Their love is like no other together they fight every instinct in their body to run to harm to kill.  He doesnt think he has what it takes to be a good man for her and she cant give up on him Its a love that fights all battles and has the ability to destroy them both.   You are worthy.  Every day I spend with you your improving.  Only because I keep my distance and dont touch you.  Believe me if you knew my thoughts you would run.  Do you want me to run?  You should.  You own me body and soul Hazel Hunter.  Youre not just my lover but also my handler and I will walk over blades for you.  I will kill for you.  I will lay down my life for you.

671,  Intense Stars  There are no words to describe what I feel after reading this book!  I am absolutely speechless...  I mean Seriously???  I dont normally drink but after all that I think I just may need one or !  There has to be another book!  Ok so I spent a big part of the book in a love hate relationship with Twitch and Lexi.  Its rare you read about a hero like Twitch and that makes him all that more interesting.  Theres something about Twitch.  Hes just raw.  He is just all kinds of twisted but at the same time he had his sweet and happy moments with Lexi.  These two together are just a complete loving mess.  Dont feel sorry for me.  And dont assume you know me.  You dont know shit about me.  The story begins when we meet  year old Alexa trying to take care of a beat up  year old Antonio.  She feels sorry for him and tries to help him as best as she can.  But what she doesnt realize is that little act of kindness changed both of their lives forever.  Youre hurt.  No one else cares if Im hurt.  I whisper I do.  We stand there staring at each other a long time.  Finally he comes closer to me and asks Whats your name?  Alexa.  Alexa Ballentine.  He nods but says nothing.  Finally he comes closer to me and asks Whats your name?  Doesnt matter.  Youll forget it once Im gone.  Stepping closer I promise  No I wont.  Lifting his head he runs a hand through his messy brown hair to keep it out of his face.  He watches me a second more before he utters Antonio Falco.  As I read this book several parts of if made me contemplate putting it down and moving on to another book less... RAW... But thats just the thing though the story of Twitch and Lexi was just so intense and captivating that I had to keep reading and had to know if they did get their HEA.  Monsters dont always lurk in the shadows.  Sometimes they hide in plain sight.  I dont want a knight in shining armor.  I dont want a knight in scuffed armor.  I want his helmet to have dents.  I want my knight to be real and dark and savage.  I want my knight to be a survivor.  Someone whos been tested and got through his trails.  Not some pussy in gleaming metal.  So yes listen to the authors note This is not a love story.  This is a story of love gone wrong.  So if you cant handle reading a book that will strip you bare with every dark twisted compelling heart wrenching page.  Youll be forever unsatisfied.  No one will ever take care of you the way I can.  The way I know you want it.  I know what you need Lexi even if you dont know it yourself.  But Ill teach you.  I wont give much of the story away because reading it all for yourself is an experience you dont want to miss so I dont want to ruin it for you.  Ill just leave you with this... If you want a crazy complicated heart stopping soul wrenching story then you this is a MUST READ for you!   Shes in danger though.  And I need to keep her safe.  Because I love her.  Id kill anyone who tried to hurt her.  You said youd never leave me.  And Im holding you to that.  Because when youre safe again Im coming for you Angel.  link: http://jenreadit.com/raw.html,4,True
672,  Stars  Only for you  By: Genna Rulon  I will be honest and say that I expected the book to be much better.  In the first few chapters the banter between Everleigh and Hunter had me laughing and picturing really good things for the rest of the book.  But as the book progressed I feel like something was missing.  There was that great connection in the beginning Moments where I thought would be hilarious once discovered...  Sir you are no gentleman.  And you Miss are no lady.  What man can quote a scene from the  film classic?  That does not happen in real life hell it doesnt even happen in books.  I halted hastily in the middle of the parking lot.  Of courseit was obvious as a hooker at a debutant ballHunter.  Was.  Gay.  It explained his extraordinary looks for no straight man looks that goodits Gods joke at womens expense.  It explained his dislike of women at least this woman.  It explained his willingness to sit and listen to emotive music and contemplate the lyrical significance.  Most importantly it was the only plausible explanation for him quoting Rhett Butler the dashing yet scandalous civil war hero from the gold standard of chickflicks.  and then nothing...  Dont get me wrong the author had a great story the characters were lovable and fun but there was just something some connection missing.  I must say I loved Ev though she was simply one of a kind  Was he a cyborg created to epitomize masculine perfection testing the restraint of earthly women?  But who will bring me coffee in the mornings and breakfast treats?  Youre running a coffee shop.  You have those items at your disposal Hunter laughed.  That is true but who will give me big bear hugs each day?  Im sure you can persuade Sam to fill in for me when needed.  Shes physically incapable of giving me a bear hugshe can only provide tiny cub hugs.  So... in the end of the day this book is still a must read because everyone NEEDS their Everleigh and Hunter Fix.  Do you remember my tattoo?  I had it inked at the end of March.  Do you remember what it means  Forever.  You said it was the Japanese word for forever eternal.  Exactly.  Forever.  He put his hand over his heart and repeated himself separating the words ForEver.  I already knew for me there is only you.  No matter what happened between us in the future it would only ever be you.  I was made for youonly for you.  Anything I can do to help you?  Just be you Everleigh.  Thats all I need.  http://jenreadit.com/onlyforyou.html,3,False

677, Layers Deep Layers Trilogy   By: Lacey Silks Goodreads Author    Deep Stars   One word...  Cliffhanger!!  Ugh have I mentioned how much I hate cliffhanger?  Its a bittersweet feeling because in a way its good for the anticipation on what will happen next but in this case NOT SO MUCH!  Great read that may leave you blushing and wanting more... Now how can I explain my feelings about this book properly without giving too much away ??  Cross was too hot for his own good.  I couldnt let his Zeus like looks and charming mouth derail my plans.   Of course I liked him!  Even Mother Teresa would have liked him.  I dont sleep around Allie.  Im a onegirl kind of man.  I think that pretty much covers it Right?  Other than screaming HOT DAM!!!  So to Sum up Allie needs Tristan for her Revenge Tristan needs Allie for his Rescue the lines get blurred and things get OH SO INTERESTING!   Hit me.  I could have sworn Id heard a slight growl in his voice.  What?  Its not a request.  If you want me to consider you for the job you need to pin me to the floor.  You just want me on top of you.  I crossed my arms at my front.   Actually I want you under me and I wont have it any other way.  He grinned  I loved the story of Allie and Tristan It was a mixture of the beginning of their love but also gave you an insight on one of the biggest worldwide issues we have today... SEX TRAFFICKING.  Allie has to go under cover to get sold as a sex slave in order to try to save Tristans ex from being sold.  It was crazy to see the reality of sex trafficking.  As much as I hated reading about what some of the women went through in the book because I know its a reality in our lives more than wed like it to be it was a good way of showing the readers what many women out there are going through.  If I had a choice I wouldnt hire you.  Id keep you far away from the scum well be dealing with.  But youre too perfect for the job.  Youre beautiful smart and strong.  But on a lighter note... Allie and Tristan Cross were a great pair.  They completed each others every need with trust in each other from day one.  The chemistry between these two simply left me fanning myself...  Cocky a bit?   I guess youll have to wait and see.   Youre unbelievable.   I Know.  And Im glad you know it too.   Have you always been a tease Allie?  Or is it just for me?  What?  You say one thing but mean something else.  I can see the way your bodys reacting to me.  I mean come on... What can you really say to that?   You look beautiful when you blush.   You should get off me.  I felt my muscles tense.  I should and I will but know that I dont want to.  WOW!!   You taste much better than I imagined.  Imagined?  I wondered about your lips all night and couldnt sleep.  Now I dont have to wonder anymore.  Im glad I satisfied your curiosity.  But as much as Allie tried to keep their relationship strictly professional it only worked for about  seconds.  It was great to see the sparks between these two.  Because honestly with a guy like Cross I dont really blame her!   Id tasted forbidden fruit I couldnt get enough of.  And I wanted more I needed more.   Mr.  Impossibly hot could not only make me swoon in bed but also in his kitchen.   You perv!  Were supposed to be exercising.   Believe me my heart gets a better work out when I look at you.  So Like I said I hate Cliffhangers therefore I need more of Tristan!!  Like NOW !!  So keep posted for the second installment Layers Peeled.  Cant WAIT!

678, . Stars  Ok so under normal circumstances Nick would be all kinds of creepy for watching Daisy.  But looking at it as a fictional perspective.... Its still odd but once you read on and get to know Nick you understand that in a way he doesnt know any better.  I was born a killer my teeth bared and I claimed my first victim almost before I had taken my first breath.  But that is Ukraine.  A boy on the streets without a gun is prey.  I have never been prey.  Always the hunter.  It takes many muscles to smile more to frown but only few to pull the trigger.  Of course being the main characters and all you cant help but fall in love with Nick and Daisy.  To watch both of them get over their fears and discover life together.  There is something so vibrant so aware so alive about him that it sings to me.  I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame.   I will kiss you Daisy.  I will kiss you all night.  I will do more than kiss you if you wish.  Daisy has just escaped her fathers prison and Nikolai is attempting to free himself from the only life he knows at the same time they are trying to build their first relationship.  Neither one of them knows what to do whats right and wrong in a relationship.  But together they work on building their trust and love for one another even through the obstacles their old insecurities and fears throw their way.   I knew I could not keep you he says.  His voice is hoarse with emotion.  Such a beautiful innocent soul.  I just wanted you for as long as I could have you.  I knew it was wrong and I did not care.  Someday I hope you forgive me.  There were times I just wanted to shake some sense into Daisy and there were times that I also wanted to tell Nikolai to Man up but I did enjoy learning about them.   The villains had a hard life.  They did not know any other way forward.   I cant hate Nick.  Im still hopelessly in love with him.  With the bad guy.  I wonder what this makes me.  I am not going to lie its an interesting read its not usually my favorite kind but I thoroughly did enjoy reading it.  Would I recommend it?  Yes I definitely would.   I love Nick for who he is Not what he is.  See the truth in my eyes and know I do this for you.  But whatever you decide Kitten I will support you.  Their love for one another despite all their struggles is so captivating that it makes it hard to explain.. So Ill just let their own words do the explaining...  Spasiba.  Why do you thank me?  For caring enough to care about how I feel.  I do not think you realize Daisy.  You are everything to me.   Every day that passes I love Nick more and more.  I dont care about his past.  We will build our own future together.   Were both patient people Nick and I. We know how to wait theres pleasure in the waiting.  So Read it Trust Me you will enjoy it!

680,   AMAZING STARS  Ruin  By: Rachel Van Dyken  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I laughed out loud Smiled myself silly and Cried my eyes out but LOVED every single minute of it!!  I cant stress this enough but I LOVED LOVED LOVED the story of Wes and Kiersten.  Its an Amazing MUST READ!  It will leave you so caught up in emotions that you will be speechless and thinking about this book for weeks.... Trust me!  I turned around... and ran smack dab into a tree.  Or at least it felt like a tree.  But trees werent warm.  And they didnt have one two three four six Good Lord eight?  Eight packs?  Furthermore had I actually been feeling said persons eight pack?  And dear God I was counting.  I had touched each muscle.  And great my hand was still firmly placed against the guys stomach.  I jerked my hand back and closed my eyes.  Were you just counting my abs?  I think that in itself is enough said about Wes dont you think?  How can you not fall in love with him?  His eyes held my ruin.  Weston.  He held his hand .  And you are?  Screwed  Kiersten.   I seriously couldnt stare at him in the face that was how gorgeous he was.  Id never seen such a good looking guy in real life before.  Sure Id seen them on magazines and movies but this guy... He was living breathing walking sex.  And considering I had no experience in that department I was putting up every wall I could think of in order to remember to breathe.  I loved their instant connection and hilarious heartwarming banter.  I couldnt help but smile almost the entire time.  I dont get it.  I could have sworn the freshman RA was a female.  Sex change Weston said with a straight face.   I was a confused child.   Funny.  I rolled my eyes.  Seriously?  I requested an all girls dorm and got put in a coed building and then my RA is a  I was going to say hot guy by refrained from embarrassing myself.  Sex god.  He said it for me.   I know some people have all the luck.  I am struggling to write a review for this without giving too much away and ruining the suspense for you so I think its easier to let the characters speak for themselves...  Lisa and Gabe were simply HILARIOUS!!  I think everyone needs a roommate and friends like Lisa and Gabe.  My screaming broke a lamp?  No.  She shook her head.   My fall broke the lamp.  Seems jumping out of your bunk bed at one in the mornings a contact sport.  My lamp being the main target.  No worries.  She sighed.   It didnt suffer.  It shattered on contact with the floor.  And then again after I slipped on the teddy bear that also fell.  And thats great since it broke my fall onto the floor making it so I escape with two faint bruises.   Holy crap!  Im so sorry!  Nah its fine.  Im a walking accident.  She laughed.   But if you plan on screaming all night Im taking the floor.  My lamp killing days are behind me.   Oh and I sleepwalk so if you wake up to me standing over you try not to punch me in the face.   Wow were sure the fun pair.  And then there is the fact that Wes is keeping a major bomb from Kiersten spoilers  I was keeping something epic from her which sort of made me the villain in this tale.  But damn I wanted to be the hero.  For the first time in a year I wanted to live  because I wanted to spend every freaking day watching her open her eyes to the world.  Hell I wanted to be the first thing she saw.  Sometimes realitys a bitch.  Enough said...  So yes Read this book Love it Devour it!  Its just that good!  But before you do be sure to get comfortable make sure you are alone  be prepared to not sleep and definitely have the tissues ready!  I can tell you have a good heart... because the minute I met you I wanted to fight for it.  She was silent.  Thats how you can tell when someone has a good heart... when you want to be the one to make it beat.  I want all of your heart even the broken pieces the shredded ones that no longer fit.  I want all of them  all of you.  I need it all.  SWOOOON  http://jenreadit.com/ruin.html,5,False

686,  Musical Stars  Maybe Someday  By: Colleen Hoover  I can honestly say that I am a HUGE Colleen Hoover book fan!  I have read both series she has written so far and LOVED everyone of them.  She has a way with words that I can honestly say I have cried my eyes out in each one of her books.  So with that in mind I have to say this book was a little different for me.  Its a really good book very well written and all I just didnt feel all of the emotions I am used to feeling when reading a Colleen Hoover book.  Dont get me wrong I really enjoyed reading the story of Ridge and Sydney.  The distinct and emotional way their love for music despite all obstacles pushed them together was amazing.  There is no way to write a full review without giving too much away so Ill try my best to let the characters words speak for themselves.  We try so hard to hide everything were really feeling from those who probably need to know our true feelings the most.  Sometimes in life we need a few bad days in order to keep the good ones in perspective.  It was beautiful to watch the two of them grow together not only through their struggles but also through the obstacles life has thrown at them.  To see them realize there is more to life then the issues they face.  A life of mediocrity is a waste of a life.  Words can sometimes have a far greater effect on a heart than a kiss.  Music is what brings them together its what brings light to the great connection they share.  Writing music together connects the two of them in a way they never thought possible to have with another.  However Ive learned that the heart cant be told when and who and how it should love.  The heart does whatever the hell it wants to do.  The only thing we can control is whether we give our lives and our minds the chance to catch up to our hearts.  These challenges and the enormity of the connection they share lead them to doing things they never thought they would be capable of.  I kiss her every way I can possibly kiss her because I plan on loving her every way I can possibly love her.  Every single time we refused to cave in to our feelings in the past makes this kiss completely worth the sacrifices.  The more I open up to him the more I need him.  The more I admit to myself that I need him the most it hurts to know that I still dont exactly have him.  I am not going to lie There were several times that I just wanted to shake Sydney and Ridge and tell them to just make up their mind already but then there was the soft side of me that can understand their struggle.  Theres no other way to describe how I feel.  I know that the way I think about her and feel about her is wrong but I struggle so much with how right it feels when Im with her.  See what I Mean??  Never in all my life and in all my years of living in a world of silence have I wanted to hear something as much as I want to hear her sing right now.  I want to hear her so bad it physically hurts.  I mean seriously???  How can your heart not hurt for these two after Ridge saying something like that?  Getting to know Ridge and the difficulties he has gone through opened my eyes to what it would be like to go through the same things.  Its crazy to see that it is a reality and what sometimes can tare someone apart can also bring others together.  God if just holding hands with him feels this intense I cant imagine what everything else with him would feel like.  I dont know when youll be ready for me.  It might be next month or next year.  Whenever it is just know that I have absolutely no doubt that we can make this work.  I know we can.  If there are two people in this world capable of finding a way to love each other its us.  So pretty much READ this book like right now!  You will LOVE it trust me!  www.jenreadit.com,4,False

700, I must say that so far I loved all of Kritens books but I REALLY Enjoyed reading the story of Chase  Faye!!  It was the perfect ending for Chace.  I loved watching Faye and Chaces relationship blossom and become what they both dreamed it would.

I loved the characters they were crazy and fun but very enjoyable to read about.  I laughed out loud throughout the entire book and loved every minute of it.

Its definitely a MUST READ!!!  I would love to read more books like it.,5,False
702, Death as an issue is not what one expects to find in young adult fiction.  It is central to this comingofage story and adroitly handled.  Accompanying this central issue are the expected themes: sexual awakening conflicts with parents identity issues choices to be made.  Early in the book we see Donna the narrator whose father has recently died deciding to become a mortician.  We follow her thinking on this as she navigates the world of senior year at high school.  The ending though predictable to adults may not be predictable to the intended audience.  And although I expected the resolutions my interest was held to see how they would be effected.  And for once changes in the characters attitudes were adequately motivated and believable.,5,False
703, I had to keep reminding myself it was written in the s ten years before Stonewall.  There was not much to locate it in time.  I havent decided if that is goodie makes it universal or badmissing its grounding in history.  It was an intense study of the selfhatred promoted by the homophobia of the times and its disastrous effects of partners both male and female.  There were stereotypical characters but the two main ones were well developed.  It was a page turner starting with something like this: tonight is the last night before the worst morning in my life.  I liked the use of flashback to tell the story  I seem to say that a lot.  The transitions of time were clear.,4,False
704, Written in  set in the sixties when Zimbabwe was still Rhodesia this novel follows two girls who are cousins in a mission school.  One is the narrator looking back at her life in the school from a more informed perspective.  There is just enough of the mature commentary to remind us of the incomplete version of the younger girl.  The first section describes Tambus life on the family farm while her brother goes to school and her attempt to grow enough corn and sell it to get her own school fees.  The next section shows her in the mission school living with her uncle the headmaster rooming with her cousin Nyasha.  The third section I will leave unidentified for it would be a giveaway.  In the second section as Tambu waits for her aunt the description of the uncles house conveys the difference between the conditions of the native population and the privileged black population.  Only very indirectly do we get indications of the white population.  The events that follow reveal the identity issues the two girls face.  I have just learned that a sequel was published in  and look forward to reading it.,5,False
705,  spoiler alert   I enjoyed this third book almost as much as the first two.  The plot had as many twists and turns and dangers mostly overcome.  I was not too surprised that Coin turned out to be a power grabber and liked the way she was dispatched with.  I liked the way the author avoided killing off either Gale or Peeta however I felt the way she dispensed with Gale was lame.  First his observation that Katniss only loved him when he was injured or needy and second his observation that the only thing he had had going was protecting her family.  These did not ring true.  And to blame him for Prims death because it may have been a weapon that he created also seemed a stretch.  Their hunting times had given them a much deeper bond than that.  Having the media people around almost all the time intensified the commentary on reality TV and having the two versions of news underlined the importance of knowledge in making decisions and of the press.  The three books together seem an indirect commentary on war video games that prepare for real war and the victors recognized the Hunger Games in the way the Capitol was booby trapped and even named the revolution Hunger Games .  I was surprised at Katniss voting for Hunger Games with the children of the decision makers of the Capitol.  I could see the revenge aspect.  I could see avoiding total depletion of population.  But it didnt seem in character for how much she had hated the games or for her moments of realizing that people in the capitol were people too.  So I am on the fence on that issue.  // On rereading after the movie.  I see Katnisss vote as strategy toward her new goal of killing President Coin rather than as a character inconsistency.  I see an intensification of the critique of the gamelike quality of the war in looking at contemporary drone warfare.  Perhaps Katnisss thought expressed only once makes enough sense to justify her shift from Gale to Peeta: She didnt need Gales anger she had enough of her own.  She needed Peetas attitude for balance.  She probably could have ended up happy with either.  Whenever objecting to Gales attitudes and strategies she balanced it with thoughts of her own actions that caused deaths of others thoughts made all the more important in these days of drone strikes and collateral damage.  Not enough that Prim is killed trying to attend the wounded there is also the tragic irony that Katniss became a tribute in order to save her in the beginning and the book ends with her death.  I see WWII connections I had missed in the last parachute attack being unnecessary because Snow was ready to surrender.  Id not believed him on the first read but came closer to believing him on the second though the ambiguity is pretty strong.  Also the double attack after medical aid has come in parallels Nagasaki after Hiroshima.  And the war to end all wars comments.,4,False
706, I had read that it was merely a repeat of The Hunger Games but decided to read it anyway.  And I am glad I did.  The revolutionary potential of Katniss actions has been noted and promoted a new level of oversight and punishment.  It read equally as well as the first one.,5,False
707, Quite a good read.  For once an ending seemed well handledonly one small piece seemed extraneous.  Some excellent character development.  I had forecast a totally different ending and mine would have worked well also but this one was better.  I find that I enjoy being right in forecasting the ending and I also enjoy being surprised by being wrong when it is well done.,5,False
708, This book should have been a nonfiction book presenting the silk factories.  The plot and characters seemed to exist only to illustrate an aspect of Chinese history or factory conditions or options in s China for women.  I am intrigued by the hair dressing ceremony wherein women could choose to become a member of the sisterhood of silk workers an alternative to arranged marriages.  A parallel ceremony to marriage the choice as permanent.  Like secular nuns.  Even if the factories allowed women to escape family and marriage even if it allowed them to send some support home it is not a good excuse for running a sweatshop and this factory did become/was always thathence the strike.  However the strike was unconvincing the results too easy.  I have read about the labor movements beginning in the US of A and I must confess that I am now interested to learn to what extent there was a parallel movement in China and if indeed it was that much easier than in the US.  There seemed an abrupt shift from isolated rural to involvement with the Japanese invasion.  While it was abrupt it may have reflected the awareness of the rural people as the fighting moved closer to them.  So I have mixed feelings about the ending.  There were slight hints earlier of trouble up north.  The entrance of difficulties still felt sudden and intrusive.  Maybe war is like that.,3,False
709, Some very interesting character development an attention holding plot.  Some historic information about World War II women prisoners though the country was changed.  Once the main character became an entrepreneur it became unbelievable but still a fun read.,4,False
710, The plot pacing was excellent and the book held my attention.  The wellrounded character development allowed me to change my opinion of several actors.,5,False
711, Two things appealed to me about this book.  First I am fascinated by animals learning human language had read about Nim Chimsky long ago and was fascinated by the use of sign language with animals.  I appreciated the notes at the end leading to research backing the novel actions and to the comment that most of the ape  human conversation was based on real conversations although the book was fiction.  Second it was a real page turner with twists and turns.  Some events I could figure out ahead and some surprised me a nice balance.,5,False
712, After reading that the author has both Armenian and Turkish ancestors I appreciated the history of the book more.  As with many novels with a historical context it dealt with history that I am not overly familiar with.  I appreciated the character development most throughout this rather slowly paced novel.  The aunts progressed from grotesques in the beginning to loveable characters by the end.  The plot had enough twists and turns to really hold my interest.  I both enjoyed and got frustrated by the alternating families and settings.  The author gave clues to help keep characters contexts straight but not clues as to which of many in some listings to remember.  I guess that is what second readings are for.,5,False
713, The plot a page turner.  The maids reflect the Mammy stereotype.  I would like to see the story written by one of the maids.  I recommend Maid in the USA by Mary Romano as a corrective.  It is an ethnography about real live maids along with research about labor law and how it hasnt been applied to housemaids.  The dialect was a sad imitation of Black Vernacular English.,2,False
714, A page turner.  Since I hate reality TV I valued the parody of it.  Some good character development.,4,False
715, I was a little slow in getting around to reading this one.  I did start it once quite a while ago but couldnt get into it.  This time I forged through the first  pages to finally become engaged as Offred told more of her past in contrast to her present.  The movement between past and present is often quick mere hints but gradually they pile up into a whole.The treatment of women is an extension of attitudes as current now as when the book was written.  For quite a number of pages the pace remained slow the life restricted routine.  Various liaisons later and the pace quickens.  For once an ending is well done.  There is ambiguity whether she is taken by friend or foe at the end.  Then there are the scholars reports in the s after the finding of the journal that is the novel.  The ambiguity is only partially resolved.  Offred made it to Maine but there is no further trace.  A parallel to the end of Offreds friend Moira.,5,True
716, I was afraid it would merely be a rerun of Pillars in a new era but it managed to add a new dimension.,4,False
717, Although it is long it was hard to find a place to put it down.  Some very interesting characters especially the women.,5,False
718, Saleem was born at midnight at the same time as India got its independence thus the novel claims the two were intertwined.  There is also the claim that past generations and history are essential to understanding identity along with future events caused by actions or inactions of the person however this idea is undercut almost as often as it is presented.  On the first reading I was just confused.  On the second I kept better track of the characters because I remembered most of the names that reappeared.  I was also better able to keep track of India/Pakastan history and politics the second time through.  I laughed frequently but most heartily at the chapter Hit the Spittoon and at the courtship in fragments with the sheet with the hole.  Fragmentation imagery abounds in the story and in the related history.  Rushdie presents an interesting study of relativity.  One memorable mention was this: India is a land of alternative realities and Pakastan a land of infinite falsehoods.  Not quite quoted exactly Another is the section about the India/Pakastan war that juxtaposes the headlines from newspapers from each country.  And a view of history: Saleem remembers things partially and fills in the gaps.  Other events make us question his reliability as recorder.  I am glad I took the time to reread it because the second reading was a valuable experience.,5,False
719, Darker than her other books.,5,False
720, The book has been around a while so I was familiar with the general themes.  Still it was interesting to read about studies and see their methods analyzed as well as getting other details to fill in the outline.,0,False
721, While each book stands alone each also refers to previous books and recognizing references adds to the pleasure.  Having read some out of sequence hinders some of my suspicions because a potential suspect arises but I know s/he appears in a later book.  That is not the authors fault.  Clara and Myrna and Ruth are major characters in this one as they were in the ones before.  The focus shifts among other villager/ investigator people though some of them seem to be steady players.  The major ones continue to be well developed and interesting.  And mostly likable.  When reading a later book and coming across a reference to the Arnot case Id expected one of the earlier books to be about it.  However the first book also referred to it in the past.  There was a bit of explanation in  and more in  for which I was grateful.  This third in the series is the best so far after a rather odd beginning with a seance.  The clues and red herrings were adroitly handled all the way to the end.,5,False
722, The primary thing for me in a mystery is how well the various options for solution are kept open till the end.  In this book that was accomplished very well.  The secondary consideration is characterization and I am really growing to like the regulars in Pennys novels.  I am amused however by what seems an inconsistency.  In the later books there is no online connectivity from Three Pines in the earlier ones there is albeit Slow.  I was about to capitalize slow however according to the book that would imply an acronym.  As in Ruths poetry Im FINE.  A good read.,5,False
723, Fun to head back to  after reading  of the more recent one more new one yet to read.  And interesting fact: Id always assumed references to prior cases were references to prior books.  However here in the first book are references to prior cases.  Either it is just part of the needed context or there will be a new novel set before this first one.  Time will tell.  Also amusing.  Here in the first one cell phones worked in Three pines.  In the later ones they dont.  And as far as I can tell an inconsistency within this first one: an early scene takes place in the bistro and it is about a delay later when that delay is explained it also happened at the bistro so would have been impossible for the waiting person to have missed it.  Small detail.  One thing I enjoy about Pennye mysteries is the characterization and it is present in this early book.  And she does well at red herring clues among the real clues.,4,False
724, Excellent as mysteries go.  Some interesting character development.  Definitely a page turner with enough false cues to keep me guessing.  And reading.  Quite a page turner.  Occasionally it was quite confusing where I was in the chronology of the story as scenes changed.  It is funny to read a series backwardsand I had happened to read the next one first.  Lessens the anxiety as the plot thickens.  But I think Ill go back to the beginning for the rest.  Nov.  Having read  I returned to this one.  I had forgotten many details already so it was an interesting read again.  Plus details had more meaning after having read the previous volumes.  After the less intriguing  my interest in this one was much higher.  Back in Three Pines the villagers again appeared some growing some not.  The richer plot and characterization was a relief and joy.,5,False
725, This is the second one I have read and both featured art.  I wonder if that is true of all.  If so I will enjoy it.  This one was well paced and had the right amount of twists false leads and turns however I am not convinced the ending was inevitable or the best possible.  One structural thing I found a little disconcerting was the extremely short segments before switching points of view.  One thing I have liked about the two I have read was that character development is as important as solving the mystery.  I will be reading more of the series.  Back references are explained enough for those of us reading out of order but Id guess it would be more fun if you knew the back story.  it will be a different kind of reading fun to read them knowing what story follows.  January   I am reading the series in order yes it is more fun reading this one and knowing the various back stories.  I found the short segments less distracting than on first read maybe because I knew the outcome so was less interested in knowing what happened and what was going to happen.  I also found the ending more believable maybe because I caught more of the details along the way.,5,False
726, Mildly entertaining.  Some interesting social attitudes and family conflicts.  Conversation was not convincing as conversation.  Unexpected ending.,3,False
727, The major spokespeople are Alma Maribels mother and Mayor Maribels friend.  Others from the immigrant community get a short vignette.  While the vignettes provide insight into reasons for immigrating and where it led the immigrants they do not seem well integrated into the novel.  I tried to look at the main character of the novel as the group called immigrants but I couldnt make it work.  It is mostly Almas story.  The plot moves well otherwise with events feeling inevitable given choices made.  And yes it seemed likely that those characters would make those choices.  The characters save one or two are quite likable and the main characters are well developed.  It was the Multnomah County Everybody Reads book and I look forward to the discussions it should promote.,4,False
728, The prose is lyrical in this memoir written to a  year old son.  I am grateful to be able to eavesdrop on the meditations on race on fear on survival.  It is written with the awareness that the struggle changes with the generations but struggle it remains.  The vulnerability of the black body remains.  You are growing into consciousness and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people feel comfortable.  None of that can change the math anyway.  I never wanted you to be twice as good as them so much as I have always wanted you to attack every day of your brief bright life in struggle.  The people who must believe they are white can never be your measuring stick.  I would not have you descend into your own dream.  I would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world .,5,False
729, I had to look up geek because it surely didnt mean the detailed interest of  say a computer geek.  So I learned the carnival meaning.  Luckily the really gross and bloody part occurred only briefly at the beginning.  The next oddity was the father deciding to produce his own freak show for the carnival based on his seeing horticultural variety at the International Test Rose Garden.  The mother dutifully took drugs to alter her offspring.  Their living children were four: Arty with fins for arms and legs Elly and Iphy the Siamese twins Oly the hunchbacked dwarf narrator and Chick the youngest with his special powers.  Had it not been a group read I might have stopped there.  However I remembered a comment of a professor about other novels with grotesques: What could the author say through them that couldnt be said through more average characters?  I decided to read a bit more through that frame.  Then the next chapter captured my attention with its narrative strategy of jumping into the future with Oly and her daughter Miranda.  Several events are revealed that make a reader wonder how they happened.  That same strategy is used a few more times like a carrot to keep one reading.  For the first two thirds of the book the pacing was very effective.  Then the notes of a reporter/participant were introduced and while they provided important information that Oly the narrator couldnt have known they dragged the pace considerably.  Also the very ending of the book while motivated seemed to take too long.  It also left me wondering to what extent it was a change in her character instead of an extension.  I have not yet answered the What could be said question.  First hypothesis something about disability issues.  Did not hold up.  Second hypothesis something about minorities.  The carnival provided a sort of ghetto where deformities were normal however the carnival was dependent on the money of the norms buying tickets.  Oly didnt feel odd till she no longer lived in the carnival setting.  One group member read an interview with the author and learned she is an environmentalist and is antiwar.  Perhaps the fathers manipulation is an extreme of the various pollutants in our atmosphere food and water.  And there was one paragraph in the reporters notes where Arty ponders how people could criticize his followers who are maimed by choice and not criticize war with the injuries it produces.  Maybe.  And is it really choice when there is cultlike power in the leader and manipulation?  I feel the need to think more on the followers willingness to endure amputation and what it might say about other things we readers may be willing to give up and for what.,3,False
730, Surreal.  Entertaining.  Far more allusions than I can recognize.  Worth pondering.,3,False
731, Although  pages is overwhelming it was a good read.  The first three or four chapters introduce readers to various interrelated groups of people other characters are introduced along the way.  At one point I counted  subplots going.  More were added.  As you might imagine that made for a lot of cliff hangersbut they werent really intense till the last  pages.  There were a few times I wanted to say Just get on with it.  But generally the pacing was effective.  Time was not linear.  Some background was withheld till the last  or so pages.  There were two major sections that provided back story.  There were some sections set in the future.  Most background bits and character sketches were relevant and interesting.  More for understanding character than furthering plot though some did move the plot along.  It was fun to see a scene reappear from someone elses perspective or as background to something else going on.  I am sure it happened more than I recognized.  Interludes likewise provided insight into characters and added to plot: a letter from father never sent two communications from a son/grandson.  There was an article written by one of the journalist characters split into twoit provided characterization and background and the second part moved plot.  However readers got to see characters reading it and reacting before we got to read that portion of the article.  There was a fanzine published by one of the characters.  Some of it was important to the plot some was extraneous.  It is a book for enjoying the journey more than finding out who dunnit.  Most of the plots were tied up.  Some resolutions Id anticipated some were very surprising.  A good mix.  I have noticed a tendency in current fiction to explain how things turn out years beyond the ending I prefer the older suggestion/hints approach to the future.. This novel projected for a couple of characters but it was not excessive.  Characters were well drawn.  I can think of only one that was totally unlikable.  Most were sympathetically presented even some Id not have liked if meeting them in real life.  The descriptions captured mood of the city and of the people.  Some were interesting for themselves.  my favorite was of the subway near the end.  Ill leave you to find it.,4,False
732, I heard Percy at the local Wordstock day and I was drawn to read the book by the description of bringing the Lewis and Clark expedition into the future apocalypse.  Actually I think the main link to history is the naming of characters.  I googled names of those on the expedition and yes they were on the original but not necessarily similar.  For example Clark is a female ranger though she led the books expedition York is her half brother though it is indicated he is dark.  I saw two parallels: Lewis kept a journal and the two got separated for a piece.  Maybe someone who knows more about the historical trek would see more subtle parallels.  The pacing was intense.  There were always several subplots going and moving back and forth was pretty well signaledonly occasionally confusing.  The shifts created many cliff hangers.  It was very hard to put down at bedtime.  And you can see I didnt put it down many times.  There were enough twists and turns but not too many.  The main characters were fairly rounded and developed.  Some of the minor ones less so having no dimension beyond their evilness.  The setting was vividly described: hot cold mutations past history the ongoing fires in oil fields were quite convincing.  There were interesting references to climate and country history as the group traveled through.  If you like apocalyptic/adventure reading you would like it.,4,False
733, This is the story of a painter who has made a few bad decisions and gets herself blackballed in the art world.  She fills her time and pays her bills making copies of paintings for a reproduction service not a crime when sold as reproductions.  And she is a Degas specialist.  The story is fiction but is based on the fact of a still unsolved theft from the Gardener Museum.  Painting and painter detail is important to the plot and interesting as well.  The plot moves between the painters present copying of a Degas for a gallery dealer as part of a bargain to get her own show to a past painting for a friend.  Gradually we learn about her first bad decision.  Interspersed are th century letters of the Gardener behind the museum to her niece a note at the end tells what is history and what is fictionthe letters are fiction.  As Claire the artist researches technique she begins to question the authenticity of the piece she is copying.  She falls in love with the gallery dealer.  And as they say the plot thickens.  The book is entertaining and from the middle hard to put down.,4,False
734, After the first couple chapters that introduce the various plots it quickly became a pageturner.  Luckily there are a few places where all seems resolved and one can put it down to do something else.  It took only a few pages to realize water war was not a metaphor.  Sometimes it seemed there was more gory detail than necessary to make that point.  The subplots merge in believable ways.  The medical detail is not always so believable even with the future orientation.  The major characters are mostly likable though I did not always like all their decisions.  And yet even those decisions I disliked seemed in character.  It did modify my water usage.,4,False
735, One of the most amazing things about this book was that in spite of knowing the ending it was suspenseful through and through.  The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue me and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much.  The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantzhowever as he requested it is told in the context of the boatmore than the shell that they propelled with oars the boat is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony.  The physical boat too is a character and Pocock its maker stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building.  The story is told in the context of the Depression the Dust Bowl and the drums of encroaching World War II.  Joes surmounting of personal struggles as well as economic is admirable.,5,False
736, The title led me to expect the book to be more about horses than it is.  However horses move the plot.  Martha ends up with a circle of ranches at which she breaks horses so the novel is about the people at the various ranches.  Reading that the novel had seeds in Maries story in Cowgirls: Women of the American West made me want to read that oral history too.  I was delighted to read a book with the main character a woman doing mans work as an equal.  I would have preferred less of the romance.  At first it seemed that the competent Woodruff sisters who owned one ranch on her circuit would remain her role model.  I would have liked to see her strong and independent character remain.  However I was won over a bit with her demands when Henry proposed and his acceptance of them.  The characters are mostly well rounded the positive ones more than the negative.  The latter seem all bad throughout.  The setting is  so there are a few cars a few ranches with telephones and of course WWI in the background.  The novel started rather slowly but my interest intensified and it was hard to put down after it got moving.,4,True
737, Taleb is writing theory but he wants to relate it to experience to work bottom up from experience.  He is more interested in premises than the logic built from them.He eschews closed systems that have lost touch with lived reality.  He wants practice to account for the black swan events the unpredictable rare event positive or negativewith great impact.  Current economic models do not.  He is skeptical about what can be known or predicted about models.  He speaks of false confirmation every white swan seems to confirm that swans are white however one black swan disproves it.  He speaks of other thought processes that misguide.  He occasionally speaks to how to live with uncertaintyignore what has low impact avoid the negative with high impact or at least bolster yourself against the possibility and seek to be open the the positive possibility.  Where he does touch on practical measures other than recommending we withhold judgment on important issues or bolster against loss I find our ways diverging.  He briefly touched on climate change.  Though he agrees it is a problem he is skeptical of the modeling there too.  And though he thinks the misleading of financial models is a problem he blames regulation for creating the need for predicting.  The book vacillated between interesting and tedious.  Although Taleb nodded to art literature and medicine most of his arguments and examples came from the world of finance an unfamiliar and minimally interesting world to me.  He appears to be trying to introduce paradigm shift into financial/risk management thinking and as such has to give more arguments and evidence than I as a lay person needed.,3,False
738, After reading an intriguing review in the Womens REeiew of Books I had to read the book.  From the review I learned that the novel included two related narratives half of the editions started with the one narrated by the th Century painter the other half by the daughter of a woman who had loved a painting by that artist.  I dont think there is any way to tell which edition you are getting other than the illustration just before Chapter  The girls has the security camera the artists has eyes.  I got the girl first and I am glad.  Both narratives are stream of consciousness with fluctuations from past to present.  The girls moves from life before her mother died to her present.  The artists moves from his life and times to the girls present as he follows her after she looks at one of his paintings.  The links were harder to follow in the artists section and had I started reading there Id have been quite disoriented much of the time.  However reading it second I could use cues from the girls earlier narrative.  Of course Ill never know what it would have been like to start with the artist.  Both stories were intriguing and held my attention.  And as the review stated juxtaposing them creates a third narrative.  I have a lot of thinking to do on that third one.  The characters seemed real and likable.  There were so many boths to ponder being.  Occasionally the author was a little heavy handed in reminding us to think about such distinctions but that was rare and also forgivable.  Some that I pondered were both living and dead both old and new both viewer and viewed Im sure there are more.  It is a book worth rereading.,5,False
739, The setting is the end of the Vietnam war the main character tells us early on that he belongs to the North but works under cover with the South.  Presented as a spy novel it is but it isnt the thriller one might expect.  It is more an exploration of character of times and of the interaction.  It has philosophical moments that are entirely in character and not intrusive thoughts on being of two minds on representation and on nothing.  The latter was interesting but I am not sure how seriously to take it.  The former makes me think that if I were still teaching I might join this book with How to Be Both in a unit.  For me the theme of WhoGetstoRepresentUs?  enters with the chapters about a movie script and its shooting.  However that was a ways into the novel so I might reread to see if I missed its actual beginning.  When the movie chapters appeared they seemed an interruption but gradually they were woven into the whole.  The plot was slow as character explorations tend to be slow in a good sense.  There were moments where action was faster paced and it was a page turner.  There was a nice rhythm between the two.  We are told early on that the narration is really a confession to a commandant so we keep wondering what the narrator did to get him into that position.  We also expect and get some torture scenes.  They feel really long while reading them but dont take a large percentage of pages.  Some of the characters have names.  Some dont but rather are identified by position and sometimes affect: the crapulent major the congressman the affectless lieutenant.  It would be worth a second read to look for a pattern of who gets named and who doesnt.  It isnt wholly major/minor characters.  It doesnt create stock characters.  It may relate to the degree in intimacy with the narrator but Im not ready to commit to that.  It is a novel worth reading once to see how it ends it is worth rereading to ferret out deeper meaning.  Second Reading  I marveled more at the skill of the streamofconsciousness the shifts were managed such that I almost always knew where I was in the larger narrative.  And I marveled at turns of phrase and metaphors more than I noticed on the first reading.  And as usual on a second reading I was more alert to how all the small parts fit together into the larger structure.  I did list the characters named and unnamed there seem to be an almost equal number of each.  I still dont see a pattern but will keep looking.  The representation theme  morphed into an identity theme and the narrator shifted from I to we when speaking of himself.  It seemed a culmination of his mothers saying he was not half but all of each nationality a culmination of his finding his place in his two spy roles.  The ending and the play on nothing remain fascinating.  nothing becoming a positive and transforming the meaning of Nothing is more important than freedom and independence.  Man the blood brother and the commissar in charge of reeducation leads the narrator to see that what starts as revolution ends as a power grab hence as nothing.  And yet hope does not die.  Reading the torture aka reeducation scenes I wondered if that was intended to judge the communist side that the narrator had been working for as a double agent the ending being a point of emphasis.  And yet it was the CIA manual that they used to orchestrate the torture.  So it was not a single national judgment.  The narrative style changes abruptly at the end.  The slowpaced narration of a life becomes a mix of first and third person reporting and told contemporaneously with events rather than as memory.  It also becomes more philosophical though still not intrusive.,5,True
740, I thought that I had thought all the necessary questions about endoflife decisions and I had thought many.  But Gawande opens up new questions for evaluating those issues.  Gawande also opens up new ways to think about dealing with debilitating changes forced by disease or age.  He offers a critique of traditional nursing homes of what assisted living has become and of medical practice based more on procedures than persons.  His illustrations with case studiessome showing failure others showing successtake the book beyond theory to readable.  Gawande challenges the narrow focus on safety and extending life and replaces it with concern for quality of life.  He notes that people making qualityoflife decisions for patients often think in terms of what they themselves want not what the patient would want.  He questions the Maslow hierarchys application to all ages and stages.  Freedom to be the author of our lives within whatever circumstances we are dealt becomes primary.  He offers discussion questions for medical personnel and family to use to understand what the patient sees as desirable quality of life then urges discussion of ways to accomplish it.,5,False
741, The book held my interest.  The pacing between present and past added interest even if it did occasionally get difficult to follow.  The characters were likable and mostly believable.  Not sure about Atticus.  Were we to see his interest in the council as the abstract earlier interest in the Klan only to see who else was involved or maybe to temper it or was it a total sellout as Jean Louise sees it.  Is his praise of her finally being able to make a judgement different than his believable?  Not quite.  Worth having read.,3,True
742, Yes I read it in one day.  The start was very slow and gimmicky.  I might not have finished had it not been a group read.  However about / into it the pace and interest picked up.  The twists and turns and clues and red herrings were interesting to follow as the book forged on to solve the whodunnit.  Usually I like a novel with several stories that end up merging.  These were somehow annoying.  They merged from the beginning and the shifts were annoying and confusing.  I resented having to look back at chapter headings to see what was simultaneous and what past.  Characterization: Tom was well developed.  Rachel was sometimes a convincing alcoholic sometimes not.  I did not find her particularly likeable.  Anna seemed stereotypical for the most part.,3,False
743, This novel is mostly a meditative stroll through a town where we meet various inhabitants over several days.  The time is marked by a countdown starting with the man who has  days to live.  While action is mostly slow paced there are a couple cliff hanger moments of high anxiety as well.  It is filled with Irish story telling and Native American story telling as father and grandfather record stories for grandson Daniel.  Grandfather called by two names: Worried Man and Billy pursues a quest.  Readers are drawn into the town and the lives of the characters slowly narratives shift among the characters as well to enrich our understanding of the towns people.  The style is both beautiful and annoying.  Overall the description is part of the pleasure of reading however occasionally the cataloguing gets to be tedious.  Usually however it is enriching and beautiful.  One device I particularly enjoyed was the cataloguing based on one image.  For example the statement Everyone is kneeling is followed by a listing of all the characters kneeling in various waysnot churchy at all some kneeling in a garden for example.  It provides a kind of summary before moving on to another scene.,4,False
744, The premise is cute Flavia de Luce an eleven year old girl precocious and very interested in chemistry is the sleuth.  The dysfunctional family leaves her with lots of time on her own and with her trusty bike she goes where she needs to go when she needs to go there to solve the mystery of the strange death.  However many deductions seem too advanced even for a precocious child.  And many behaviors too childish for eleven.  Once you forgive that it is a good read.  The plot held my attention in spite of several unbelievable coincidences.  There were enough false leads just plausible enough that when the solution appeared I was surprised.  A nice light read for a day at the airport.,4,False
745, What had appealed to me in listening to the author at a Powells reading was her comment that the book treated both sides equally and in fact was said to be more favorable to the Tamils author Sinhalese.  I thought that quite a challenge.  And then characters from each side link up at the end and of course I wanted to know how.  Id expected a more psychological linking than happened.  I did not find the handling equal.  The Sinhalese family was presented in two generations the Tamil one.  The Sinhalese family was presented as aware of the civil war and ultimately leaving the country the Tamil family as actually participating in the war.  It is the latter that made it seem more sympathetic to the Tamil cause.  Those things said it was an interesting read and I learned more about the Sri Lankan civil war than I had known.,4,False
746, It was interesting to reread this as an older adult!  When I read it in college I missed the clue on page  that Holden was in a hospital I missed that he was stinking rich and that he was depressed.  I didnt like him much better than I did the first time but I didnt take his declarations of others phoniness as seriously as I did on first reading.  I saw more of him more of his finding his own faults in others more of his trying to help others to blunt his own need for help.  I read it for a discussion group and our reactions ran the gamut.  Some thought Holden was a critical thinker.  Im not yet convinced.,4,False
747, It has been a while since I read it so I have forgotten details but I remember mostly liking it.  I wondered if amnesia would alter a personality as much as shown but the author did do research.  And the fiances getting to know the new woman is a sort of reminder that we do change and that we shouldnt assume details about another.,4,False
748, This is a gripping story of the fragility of identity and memory along with medical detective work to find the disease causing the problems.  It is a mix of memoir what it feels like to lose ones mind and journalism the author using her reporting skills to fill in where her memory fails.  The medical disease presents a mix of psychotic symptoms hallucinations mood swingsamong others along with physical symptoms numbness of one side seizures.  Solution was further complicated by medical tests coming back normal.  At one point Cahalan remarks how her disease could not have been found with current medical practices emphasis on speedy visits and the bottom line.  It took a doctor with time to listen and heed all the relevant data some of which had fallen through the cracks in the previous exams.  It also could not have been treated without a hefty health insurance an a family able to pay what the insurance would not.  The narrative is mostly chronological and the story well paced.  First you read to see what is wrong and then to see how she recovers.  It is not a spoiler to say she recovered one can figure that out because she has written the book.  Medical information and social commentary are tucked into the narrative in small readable bits.,5,False
749, I read this book after hearing the author read from it and enjoying the humor.  It is the story of an old woman who lives alone and translates books.  She does one a yearnever intending to publish them the joy is in the doing.  She has a very distant relationship with the other women in her apartment building mostly observing them and commenting usually negatively on their behavior.  Because she is so bookish she frequently alludes to or quotes from a large number of books some familiar and some not.  Sometimes the references are apt.  It doesnt matter if they are recognized or not to the content of the allusions but there are times when it slows the action to a grinding halt and seems intrusive beyond characterizing the old woman.  And the fault I find with so many books: the ending is not believable.,3,False
750, This book has highs and lowsstars are the average.  There are two plots one during World War I and the other more current.  Mostly they are signaled well and the back and forth fairly well placed.  AFter the second is introduced readers quickly learn the connection though the main conflict takes a dozen or so more pages to be revealed.  From there on it is hard to put the book down.  Sophie the WWI heroine is presented at first as feisty and fast thinking.  One thinks of The Zookeepers Wife and her various close calls averted by onthespot thinking.  Disappointingly Sophie makes some decisions that dont seem congruent with that first picture but the plot depends on them.,3,False
751, Although called a novel and appearing to be  pages the pages are small and the margins large which makes it more like a long short story.  It also reads more like a short story in its compactness.  I am sure there is more to glacier imagery than I have gotten so far but I have seen history mystery and the slow disappearing.  The imagery of glaciers calving appeared twice: on the imagined trip from Seattle back to Alaska and later to describe the parents relationship: everything important calved away.  To Isabella the glacier represented her life in Alaska when the family was whole.  Isabella dwelt in the past through her shopping in vintage shops for everything and her career in the library repairing old books.  She also dwells in an imaginary world.  She has friends gay male friends.  She has a secret crush on another library worker.  That she and Spoke had the one intimate scene before his leaving did not seem likely given her lack of directness in other encounters.  The imagined life Vs.  the actual life is reinforced by a brief comparison of the library staff in the basement to super heroes disguised as geeks.  The narration wove skillfully between past and present between imagination and experience to draw a photo of Isabella.  Poignant was her hope that her life would not end up in a shoe box of photos in an antique store.,4,True
752, sometimes one needs a fluff read.  But also need enough time to finish at the cant put down stage.  This one had too much prolonged history of Italy and Italian language detail in the beginning.  Some was needed for setting and character development and to establish fear but most felt like filler.  Toward the second half it became a better read.,3,False
753,  spoiler alert   The book totally held my attention and it avoided overly romanticized developments and endings.  Most of the characters were likable some took a while and a revelation or two to achieve that status.  Only one Patrick never became likable to me.  Whose story was it Lous or Wills?  I think Lous.  And that is one reason it had to end as it did.  She could not have gone on considering herself the reason Will stayed alive.  Just think of the reaction when she moved in with Patrick.  The mothers reaction colored future decisions of Lou and how she could present herself.  Her life would have been totally stifled thinking what effect any decision she made would have on Will.  It would have become a prison.  And I think it good that there was no lovesolvesall ending.  The book did a good job of exposing peoples reactions to people with visible disabilities the lack of adequate modifications to ease their independence the difficulty of negotiating details.  And it alerts to some possibilities that exist  But where were the adaptive equipment and counseling.  Why hadnt some counselor gotten Will the computer equipment long before Lou introduces it why hadnt he been introduced to the online quad support group.  Why didnt he get to the group instead of Lou.  There were sports he could do and nothing was wrong with his mind.  He could have continued at his job.  Even though it was a good read I was put off by stereotypes.  It was written from an ablebodied bias that life without an able body is not worth living.  I do realize there would be no plot if that were taken away.  I remember a discussion once on differences between stereotype and experience: the able bodied says a person is confined to a wheel chair the person in the chair sees it as a mobility device as freeing them to be able to get around not confined.,4,False
754, Ive always been interested in the history of medicine this history of uses of cadavers includes some of that as well as some history of past funerary practices and projected possibilities.  There is some good and surprising information to be had about uses of bodies in research beyond the anatomy class.  There are also sections where animal research is described and it isnt pretty.  It would prompt PETA actions.  Occasionally and briefly questions are raised about our attitudes toward death but the questions are raised and dropped when detailed discussion would be profitable.  What I really objected to was the attempt at humor.  A few of the asides were actually funny very few.  Mostly they were intrusive and too cutsey.  I would probably have stopped reading if it werent for a group discussion.,2,False
755, Jennie Shortridge was one of the presenters at Portlands  Wordstock Book Fair.  The portion she read appealed to me.  Because the spark of inspiration for the story was a newspaper article and because Shortridge talked about her research I was able to believe some character changes that otherwise I might not have.  The novel is about a woman who experiences trauma induced amnesia it starts with her becoming aware of being in the water up to her knees not knowing what she had gone searching for.  The chapters alternate with hers her fiances and an aunts gradually filling readers in on needed background.  The struggle in addition to regaining memories involves reestablishing a relationshipor not.  Lucie without memory is such a different person than her previous self that it is hard to imagine the finance having loved the former and also able to love the new Lucie  The shifting perspectives helps readers to care about almost all the characters as we see the relationships from various angles.  Information is well paced returning memories are also well paced.  It is how I would imagine memories to returnsmells and sights triggering vague recollection when more rational processes are shut down.,4,True
756, After a sample of three I see a pattern: lone character in a strange setting establish the setting for a couple chapters then gradually introduce other characters and fill in the past that got them to the strange state.  I enjoyed references to the first volume.  This second book had more slow moments than the first of the series but when it was good it was very good.  I am not yet sure what to make of the Gods Garden religion.  Sometimes it seemed excessive other times wise.,3,False
757, Very intriguing dystopia a world after GMO reached extremes.  Interesting switch between past main character Jimmy and future characters name changes to Snowman.  The name keeps the time frame clear.  Snowman feels responsible for the altered children of Crake.  It takes the whole novel to find out why.  It held my interest.  Snowman is the most developed character.  Oryx and Crake are less complex.  Good enough read to prompt my getting the second book of the trilogy.,4,False
758, Thoroughly enjoyable to read difficult to put down.  Sustained my interest through all  pages.  The characters were for the most part quite believable.  One change in Mary was hard to imagine though.  The shift from being flattered by Theodores attention to rejecting him seemed too sudden  Marys disillusionment with northern society black and white was convincingly presented.  There is a historical noteessentially little is known.  Mary Bet McNiven Wilson Bowser and David Bustill Bowser were real people.Bet and Mary really were spies for the Union.  There are two memoirs.  Mary is mentioned by Bet Bet and Mary are singled out by McNiven.  Both are scant mentions.  This gives room for the fictive imagination to play.  Much of the information getting and sharing is believable but details that seem to give Mary control over what happens in the Union Armys activities are sometimes far fetched.  Especially that she had the power to withhold information that prolonged the war because a premature victory would leave slavery intact seemed strained.,4,True
759, The book was quite funny in a Forrest Gump sort of way.  Well I see on the book cover that that comparison was already made.  Oh well so be it.  It was funnier at the beginning got a little old by page  and there were about  more pages to go.  To what extent was this tale of a nonpolitical person inadvertently influencing political decisions meant to be commentary as well as entertainment?  Im not sure.  If it is meant to show illogic in decision making it does not provide a pretty picture.  The bumbling police and journalists also do not create confidence but they made me laugh a lot.  But its really funny only if seen as untrue.,4,False
760, A moving story of a royal familys exile from Phnom Penh in the days of the Khmer Rouge.  Time is marked by the birthdays of the narrator who was seven at the beginning of the novel otherwise day runs into day to the reader as it probably would to those experiencing the relocation and forced labor and hunger.  At least twice the dark irony of improvements upon the ways of the peasant rice farmers appears improvements that ignore accumulated wisdom and inevitably fail.  Sometimes that wisdom is told as overheard conversations.  Occasionally the child narrators observations and questions are convincingly childlike however overall the depth of thought and beauty of description is more adult.  And yet even though it was difficult to remember the age of the narrator I am not sure I would have wanted to give up the language with which the tale was told.  Perhaps an omniscient narrator would have worked better.  Still no narrator choice is without loss as well as gain.  There is a point where the mother decodes a note I wondered both Why so late?  and Would she have been able to use the information if she had understood it earlier?  Also I wondered at the two dimensional nature of the child military the Khmer Rouge.  Perhaps that is all a seven to ten year old child could see but rarely is someone pure evil.  There is more beauty than flaw in this novel and it provides insight into a time it behooves us to understand.,4,False
761, First reading  I am hooked on the series The Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  This second book had more violence than I remember in the first one but the plot wasnt limited to escapes and failures at escaping.  There is character development mystery and philosophizing too.  And as in the first book in this one there are cross overs between a novel the narrator is reading and the narrators experiences.  Description keeps the other worldly atmosphere vivid at times almost Poelike.  Although at times I wanted the author to get on with the story I usually appreciated the scene and mood setting.  Second reading   I did not enjoy this second book as much as the first of the series on this second reading of both.  I had forgotten enough that familiarity doesnt explain the difference.  The ending was not satisfying too magical not enough in character of the boss.  Cant help wondering where . and  will take the series.,4,True
762, The novel tells of Ifemeu and Obinze their lives in Nigeria US and UK.  Along with them are many other well developed characters major and minor.  A few who made short appearances were twodimensional.  We learned many ways to be Nigerian and American through the characters but none of them existed only to be illustrations.  I enjoyed all  pages and was in suspense till the very end as to the conclusion.  And I would have found it a satisfying read if it had ended in two of the three ways Id anticipated tolerable for the third.  And every page was necessary to get to that conclusion.  The narrative movement was not chronological though there was a clear timeline to the present section.  The back story appeared more thematically as it related to the present story.  The bulk of the novel was back story.  The social commentary was well handled never controlling the narrative appearing often through Ifemelus blogfirst through subject lines then through actual entries.  Other appearances through conversations of Ifemelu and her friends.  Always natural and appropriate to the context.  The style is worth remarking.  Vivid descriptions help evoke an unfamiliar world.  Images such as yet there was cement in her soul  and the air wrinkling between them evoke the interior of the characters and conversations.  It leads me to want to read her other works.,5,False
763, first reading MarchMay .  I like novels where I change my attitude to characters as more is revealed about them.  I like the way the fictive novel became a character and its people and plot appeared in our novel.  I will have to think how to say the rest whether to create a spoiler or if I can say things without spoiling.  A group I am in has chosen it for this month so I am rereading it March   Sometimes plot structure is more clear on a second readingwho is speaking?  who is who?  what happened before?  I am sure I made connections on this reading that I missed on the first.  The boy Daniel is taken by his father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books to select one to remember and take care of.  He chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Corax and he begins a search for information about the author.  Thus a past story and a present story emerge stories with many parallels but not totally parallelnothing that predictable.  One has to read attentively to track which storys background fits the current chapter.  The narrator for most is Daniel but there is a surprise section narrated by another with occasional details that seem impossible or maybe I missed a cue somewhere.  However the lapse if it is a lapse is minor.  It is a first book of a series that inspires reading the next two.  Another one promised.,5,False
764, The group that selected this is a group that reads books that have to do with aging.  Now quite a few of the characters were identified as retirement age.  However in only one segment was age a factor in the novel.  Behaviors could have been most any age.  Two things were especially interesting: The narration shifted perspectives often with a moment linking up two tellings of a similar moment.  In spite of all that shifting the perpetrator was not obvious.  And secondly there was a lot more plot going on than mere whodunnit.  One weakness: the theme/message/moral was hammered too heavily.  It is number  in a sequence of Chief Inspector Gamache mysteries.  It stood alone.  There may have been references to prior novels that would be fun for those who knew them but I never felt left out.  There was enough detail.  I would read another in this series.  October : And now I am reading the series from start to finish and have arrived at .  I am rereading it to see the references to prior books as well as to refresh my memory.  While it read okay alone  stars that reading it is much richer after having read .  Not only do I know the characters better from the previous books but I also see some foreshadowing of events to come.  I dont remember so much of the foreshadowing in .  Is it a new thing or have I just become aware?  The foreshadowings are not the cliff hangers of soap operas just loose ends.  On second reading I did not feel the overpowering of the moral as much as I must have to make the comment the first time.,5,False
765, After the second reading   One of the pleasures of a second reading is that no longer needing to find out what happens next?  frees one to enjoy other features.  And to revise previous opinions.  Or to see that the wrong questions were asked.  I started reading with a focus on Ruth as planned.  The more I read the more I realized that it was not really two stories alternated but one continuous narrative that Ruths portions could not be separated from Naos.  There was so much preparation for Ruths dream encounter with Naos father Haruki that it wasnt deus ex machina at all.  Early on Ruth had two dreams of Jiko.  There was the time discussion where Oliver reminds Ruth of the ten years that had passed from the writing of the journal to the present.  There were the statements of Jiko involving apparent contradictions being equally true and the flow of identity and time.  It is background until the disappearance of words in the journal.  I still feel the philosophy was mostly well integrated.  Possibly more actual Buddhist early on and more new age when it gets heavier at the end.  I could pause and savor the many puns on time being such as Mind and words are time being.  Arriving and notarriving are time being  .  Also enjoyable were the meditations on moments and on now/Nao.  While I had intended a second reading eventually I am glad for my book group selecting the book to prompt me to do it.  After the first reading   One of my favorite narrative structures is one that combines a past through letters or journals and a present story.  And that is the basic structure of this novel.  Ruth in the Pacific Northwest on a remote island finds a packet containing a journal and other objects washed up on shore possibly from the earthquake and tsunami a couple years before .  The chapters alternate between Ruth the finder and Nao the writer.  At first I wondered why Nao would have written a journal in Englishit became clear when she revealed that she had spent her early life in California.  The pacing is interesting.  Instead of racing through the journal Ruth paces herself slowly to reflect the pace it was written.  In addition there is a French journal and some letters in old Japanesethese do not get translated immediately but add essential information when they do.  The characters are well drawn sometimes interesting sometimes ordinary.  Sometimes likable sometimes less sobut as more is revealed the major characters become more likable.  The minor ones the school contemporaries not so much.  At one point in the middle I found myself wondering about Ruths chapters.  Would her story be worth a novel without having found the journal?  What were the parallels that were going to pull the two narratives together?  I may reread it and focus more on Ruth though the natural focus is Nao.  Science philosophy and religion were woven into the novel generally not too heavily though heavier at the end.  The novel is a kind of exploration of time of existences of influence.  How seriously are we to take the question of who is creating whom?  I was intrigued by the moments of magical realism though I have not yet decided if they were integral or an easy solutions to narrative problems.  Was the happy ending believable?  Contrived?  I realize happy may be a stretch since the father and daughter may have perished in the tsunamithis possibility leads to calling it ironic rather than happy however the question remains about Ruths intervention in the fathers intended suicide.  And did I learn about Buddhism or New Age cooptations of Buddhism?  I will ponder these when I reread also.  ETA more thoughts in the spoiler section,4,True
766, I liked it well enough to want to read the other two.,4,False
767, It has hall marks of Toni Morrisons masterful style and pacing and character development.  I felt sympathy for all the characters eventuallyas she reveals more about them.  Make that almost all.  There is one doctor I could not like.  It is an amazing look into living in poverty realistically showing problems and strengths of the people.  Set in the s race is an overt issue as well.  Frank back from Korea has PTSD like symptoms.  It is short but covers much territory and if I say more Ill give too much away.,5,False
768, I was intrigued by the historynot having heard of Thomas Cromwell.  Many other names I recognized but dont remember their roles Hugh Latimer is one even Woolsey was just a name to me.  Thomas More of course I knew but I had a more holy opinion of him that of one who tortured and pursued heretics.  There were two things about the writing style that I really disliked: overuse of short choppy sentences.  Wild abandon with pronoun reference.  Sentence  of a paragraph would be about one male character.  Sentence  and following would have the he refer to Thomas Cromwell.  Yet it was not always so.  It would take reading a whole paragraph or more to know for sure who was talking sometimes.  One thing about not knowing Tudor history well: I didnt always know how some subplot would turn out.  Anne and More I did but it was still interesting to see how events worked out.  I liked it enough to read the next two books.  And may follow up with biographies.,3,False
769, Intrigued by what Id heard of the movie I picked the book up at the airport.  It was a good read for a long day.  I had not heard enough to know ahead of reading it that it was fiction so that disappointed me.  However it appears to have been researched such that it presents a plausible interior picture of Alices mental status.  I wondered though if the rapid deterioration were accurate.  The family is borderline dysfunctional: Alice and her husband differing on the younger daughters choice and the husband supporting the daughter behind Alices back Alice and that daughters inability to communicate or understand each other at the beginning.  On the other hand the two older children relate well to both parents and live nearby so we see them more often.  The marriage has been drifting into separate lives.  I found the daughters and son likable Alice likable but the husband less so.  Lydia and Alice become close as the book progresses.  The change seemed abrupt and not adequately motivated.  The story is told from Alices point of view enabling us to see inside to feel the frustration of not remembering words and responsibilities and the panic at moments when she is lost.  There is enough conversation and other detail for us to see what is happening outside of her thinking at times that her perceptions and external reality dont match up.,4,True
770, A story of growing up during WWII as a Chinese American.  son of an immigrant family.  It includes a friendship between a Chinese boy and a Japanese girl a friendship totally rejected by the father.  It was interesting to show prejudice against Japanese via the Chinese familythough there were other US/Japanese US/Chinese issues presented.  As is often the case I feel very ambivalent about the ending.  The second generation father/son relationship between Henry and Marty starts as distant as that of Henry and his father but a couple of events merge to make a believable shift.  The contrast is good.,4,False
771, The story of Liesel her foster parents her good friend Rudy and Max whom the family hid create a moving look at WWII.  Characters I dislike at the beginning become likeable at the end.  The events hold together.  The pace is mostly good.  The ending believable.  I was not enamored with Death as a character and narrator though.  Occasionally Death provided historical context for the intended YA audience and some meditations were worthwhile but most of the comments were intrusions for me.  ETA I just learned that it was not originally published as YA book in Australia.  So there goes one argument favoring Deaths function as a character in the novel.,4,False
772, The book is more of a challenge than I have time for right now.  It has come due at the library and I cannot renew it.  Ill try again later.,0,False
773, It has been a long time since Ive read a dear reader style narrative.  I found it annoying.  But I did want to know who would get the credit for creating the black tulip.  That plus it being a group read kept me reading.  At least Id been forewarned not to look for realism.,3,False
774, This novel more character study than action based begins well.  There is enough foreshadowing in the opening to grab reader attention and the characters quickly become likeable.  I enjoyed following their ups and downs and inabilities to communicate for the first two thirds.  Then it got a little old.  The author seemed to realize that possibility and did a lot of summary narrative in the last third but it was still hard to finish.  I had anticipated how each would end.  I like to be a little bit surprised.  At one point Reiko narrates a situation with a piano student.  On first reading I did not see where it was necessary to the plot or the reading experience.  I may be more observant if I read the novel again which I will not be rushing to do.,4,False
775, Kingsolver adroitly addresses climate change via a fictitious change in the migration pattern of monarch butterflies.  For the most part the information comes in a way appropriate to characters and their interest occasionally when it was something familiar to me it got tedious but usually it remained interesting.  Delarobia the narrator became increasingly interesting as a character as the novel progressed.  Characters unlikeable at the beginning gradually became likeable.  Changes were adequately motivated.  The ending was believable.  There was some wonderful humor in the mixing of cultures through characters interaction: scientific with nonscientific Appalachian with outsider.,4,False
776, This is the first Erdrich novel told from one characters point of view throughout that I have read and it is well done.  Erdrich uses a few sneaky ways to get other peoples information into the story but they are believable even the dream stories.  I was glad to see familiar names.  Nanapush has a significant role and others make a cameo appearance Father Damien a character from The Bingo Palace and two other families whose names I recognized but cant think of now.  There is an interesting balance between the tense plot moments and boyish daytoday moments as the plot moves inevitably onward to a satisfying ending.  We really get to know the major characters and I found most quite likeable.,5,False
777, Deeply troubling.  Deeply moving.  Moves inexorably to its end.,5,False
778, This amazing book caught my interest with the first paragraph and that without the in medias res beginning.  Oh there was back story but the actual plot began in Chapter  with two girls stealing fruit.  The pace is leisurely for the first two thirds then speeds up the style descriptive and immediate.  There were few characters though towns and other activities were implied.  The characters were well developed with flaws and virtuesall but one who had no redeeming qualities.  Much of the book was about ideas never stated the Orchardist himself Jane and Della sometimes Caroline Middey though she was the most likely to speak or about inability to speak Clee.  Angeline was more the one who wanted to know than one not communicating.  Each had their own type of isolation though there were also relationships.  The novel deals with aging birth the growing up of children and the diminished abilities of the elderly always matter of factly sometimes understated.  Never heavy handed philosophizing.  This is a rare book that remains excellent through the ending.  No strong woman is forced to marry.  The orchard doesnt last forever.,5,True
779,  spoiler alert   Generally I like the slow pace of C novels the extended description of setting and person.  I like getting drawn into the fictitious world.  I like the battles of wits and psychological studies.  And this novel has those.  I like that the novel is narrated as if it were a memoir written we learn at the end ten years after most events.  I dislike the hints of Beauty and the Beast mythology in Jane and Rochester.  Yes he does get tamed and become likeable but I get tired of seeing women put into the civilizing role.  I tolerated the moralizing via various characters as part of C until we came to St John.  He was just too preachy and went on way too long.  At first I shrugged it off as part of his character and I hypothesized that Bronte was mocking him in presenting it to excess especially when he claims that he has Gods will for someone else for Jane who had no such internal push to become a missionary.  Then I came to the ending of the novel and wondered why it ended with him his anticipation of death told in Revelation terms.  Was this meant to elevate him?  To make this the lesson for all from the novel?  Was it meant to say he had never changed?  That it did say but why end thus?  Is even the end part of the mockery of his approach to lifemocking importance to a self important man?  Another place that did not work for me was Rochesters narration of his past to Jane after the wedding has been called off.  Mere telling went on way too long.  I also could not believe that the feisty Jane could be almost persuaded by St John.  Yes Bronte did try to make it believable by Janes saying that she was docile and obedient until a certain level of resistance had been reached and then she would fight back.  And as a child she had been excessively obedient but then she had grown out of it.  So I wasnt convinced that she remained in character.  Of course her being almost persuaded did add to the drama.  It would have done so more had it been believable.  In spite of features which to me seemed faults overall it was a good read.,4,False
780, It was cute fun to read.  This book just proves that you just cant wait and stand by.  You have to climb the stairs lol and make the first move.  If not nothing is ever going to happen.,3,False
781, That was seriously the shortest yet cutest book I have ever read.,3,False
782, MARIE LU YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN.  RUINING MY FEELS I MEAN.  ALSO IS IT ME OR DID YOUR WRITING JUST BECAME SEXIER?  Make a better review soon since I have to study for my test tomorrow lol  April   : I JUST SAW THE COVER NOW WOWOWOWOWO COOL COOL COOL OCTOBER  SURE I CAN WAIT FOR OCTOBER  !  I checked out the pinterest about this book and oh my gosh the setting the style and the characters are just perfect.  Im getting the feeling that Adelina will be my next favorite female heroine.  This is one series you really do not want to miss.,5,False
783, HAHAHA LOOKING AT MY PREVIOUS PREDICTIONS I WAS RIGHT ABOUT TWO THINGS:  A NICO POV AND SOME PIPER ACTION  SPOILERS AHEAD  Really wanted to give this  stars.  But there were things holding me back:  unresolved questions What happens to Apollo?  The Hunters and Amazons and how did they escape from Orion??  How about freaking Leo?  FREAKING FREAKING LEO!!!  abrupt ending wait...thats it?  everythings all fine and all and bam!  another cliffhanger.  Great jusst great.  no Gaea action  i know the whole five books was the Gaea action ITSELF but if we think really deep about it we dont know much about Gaea.  I know they had to kill her fast and all but still.  At least the gods were fighting side by side with their children!  I almost cried.  BUT SOME THINGS REALLY CAUGHT ME!!  LIKE  the awesome battle scenes!!!  nicos happy ending with will solace   SOLANGELO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  jason and his glasses  leos references  percys nosebleed   the hilarious scenes that made me gag   awesomely written awesomely crafted awesomely painted  Im sad its over.  Ive been following this series since grade  and im in grade  right now.  THANK YOU UNCLE RICK FOR THE BEST MYTHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE !!!!  EVER  May    OH MY GOD THE COVER  THERES JASON!  AND THERES FRANK!  AND HAZEL!  I really like the cover!  O  Dont read if you didnt read The House of Hades!!!  Im too tired to mark this post as a spoiler!  ! BUT THERE ARE SOME WITH THE SPOILER THING THING.  Okay regarding about my baby Nico di Angelo this is what I think: Nico was trapped inside a Lotus hotel guys.  Then sent to a boarding school it was a boarding school right and he was a geeky kid back then obsessed with his cards.  Percy was the first hero probably he had seen in action.  An inspiration admiratioN!!!  HE TRUSTED PERCY.  LIKE REALLY TRUSTED HIM!  HES NOT EVEN THE GEEKY KID HE WAS BEFORE HES MORE MATURE AND HE GOT HOTTER HAHAAH ANYWAYS thats not my point.  If you love Nico for who he is then you should respect him for his feelings as he quoted Oh my god I just respect Nico so much more now!  To summarize it: I am a dedicated fangirl to Nico di Angelo.  Comments about the last book because man it took me  days to finish this book thanks to school   Leo will have a freaking girlfriend okay Rick Riordan?!  He will fall in love even deeply with  Calypso   AND THEYLL BE HAPPY TOGETHER OK.  I hope Piper will have like a major development in the last book though Im not a fan of her shes still one of the seven and she wasnt given more screen time.  Hmm.. a prediction about something war related will probably be the resurrection of Bob/another comrade.  I dont know how theyre planning to destroy Gaia/Gaea.  In the end our main characters always win.  The storm or fire thing... I really dont think its Leo and Jason :P,4,True
784, Another end of a great series.  A great way to end the series too.   Everything was properly sequenced and I never get tired of Maries alternate POVs unlike other books where it feels like theres only one narrator speaking even if there is two.  Also am I the only one whos interested in Antarctica???  That place is so cool,5,False
785, I remember discovering this book a year ago and felt dubious about it because I didnt really like Maggie Stiefvaters  Shiver .  Unexpectedly I actually liked  The Raven Boys .  I was captivated by the story of each one of the boys and Blue and my vocabulary expanded as well.  This year in  The Dream Thieves  I learned new words as well Thank God I read this in the kindle because I have a dictionary to define the words I didnt really understand.  just like last year.  But other than that I got to take a closer look on my most favorite Raven boy Ronan Lynch!  Now that I think about it Gansey is the only one who does not have the supernatural power as I would like to call it.  Maybe something will happen in the next book?  Gansey was the main lead of  The Raven Boys  if Im not mistaken.  In  The Dream Thieves  it was Ronan and I got to learn lots about his family.  Ronan is a Greywaren just like his late father.  He can procure things out from his dreams.  But!   Hes not the only Greywaren in town.  Enter Joseph Kavinsky Is he gay?  Im so confused who can do the same tricks and schemes as Ronan.  He teaches Ronan how to control his dreams but eventually Ronan ditches him because well we all know that Ronan and Gansey are inseparable.  Adam also has a little bit of tree conversing going on.  In the last book he sacrificed himself to Cabeswater so apparently hes like the eyes and hands If I remember correctly??  of the whole place which I think is pretty neat.  In my opinion Adam is the one who suffers deeply.  He was abused by his father lives his life working on  jobs and he was rejected by Blue ouch.  Im not going to blame Blue though.  Speaking of Blue nothing really much happened in her point of view in the story.  Maybe something will in the next book??  Looking back I really wished something did.  The only interesting parts was when she kissed Noah Dont worry hes dead and was almost kissed by Gansey.  Will Blue finally realize that Gansey may be the one who might die in her kiss?  But hey Kavinsky is not the only new character in  The Dream Thieves !  Enter The Gray Man a hit man who is certainly gray  from his hair to his clothes.  His job throughout the whole book was to find the Greywaren.  Only he didnt know the Greywaren is a  who .  Along the way he falls in love with Blues mother Maura!  The only thing that is keeping me hanging is the disappearance of Maura at the end of the book.  What the heck is this:  Glendower is underground.  So am I.  All in all I really enjoyed  The Dream Thieves .  Another success has been made :,5,False
786, And then all of a sudden im for team will.  ./ bc.  I wanted more fight scenes :O jem djjqjjujnfhe but will is so s weet omg,4,False
787, Im currently reading Clockwork Angel and Im liking it it is very different from the Mortal Instruments and Clockwork Princess is almost coming so I better finish the first two books probably might borrow the second book from my friend I am also borrowing the first book from another friend,4,False
788, Its a must read.  If youre the type of person who wasnt compelled to finish the Mortal Instruments this book will bring justice.,5,False
789, This book has lots of swearing so think first before reading it :P  While reading this book it felt like watching a movie with  POVs no lie.  I really like the concept of Tinys musical and his songs.  Plus this book involves gay people.  I think straight Will Grayson is actually a pretty handsome boy but doesnt know it.  The reason why I gave this book  stars might be because this book was not my cup of tea but I had lots of fun reading it.  I love both authors writings.  I cant really give a paragraph on what I thought about this book because it was a long ago so ... Im going to stop now.,3,False
790, First Neil Gaiman read,3,False
791, October  : I finally finished this wonderful book!!  HAPPY!  Probably some people are tired of it but I enjoy the fillers or the adventures they go through that distract their quest.  I guess they arent really fillers but sometimes there were some that werent really needed hahahaha  Just like the other people Nicos revelation was a huge thing for me.  Because I love Nico and his everything I kept on fangirling a few hours ago in school because... I was too excited!  Winner of Character Development goes to.......Frank!  He fought hundreds of cows by himself got a major makeover and ordered dead soldiers around!  Impressed by Frank in this book go go go Frank!  The adventures of Percy and Annabeth were the major highlight of this book for me.  I enjoyed their POVs and Bob and Small Bob.  SAD!  I dont like Piper tbh but she wasnt given the amount of screentime just like everyone else isnt that kind of unfair?  Rick Riordan are you running out of ideas?  Just like when Khione made that pun about Jason?  I didnt feel the excitement in this book the humor the comedy and that just makes me sad!  Idk if its just me but everyone has a personality except for Jason and Piper.  Also I feel like Percy is so far away ... probably because I was used to his POVs in the past books.  Were staying together he promised.  Youre not getting away from me.  Never again.  Only then did she understand what would happen.  A oneway trip.  A very had fall.  As long as were together she said.  She heard Nico and Hazel still screaming for help.  She saw the sunlight far far abovemaybe the last sunlight she would ever see.  Then Percy let go of his tiny ledge and together holding hands he and Annabeth fell into the endless darkness.  My fangirl heart ... in shatters.  DEAR RICK RIORDAN PLEASE GIVE ME A NICO DI ANGELO POV.  PLEASE.  OMG ALL THE FEELS.,4,False
792, Introducing The Mark of Athena: Unforgettable Moments!  Percy blinked.  So your brother is a winged horse.  But youre also my half brother which means all flying horses in the world are my ... You know what?  Lets forget it.  STYLE?  The giants face flushed.  I have mountains of style.  I define style.  II  My brother oozes style Otis suggested.  Thank you!  Ephialtes cried.  Bacchus stepped forward and the giants stumbled back.  Have you two gotten shorter?  asked the god.  Hold up.  Leo stepped forward wagging his Wii controller.  Did you just call my ship a monstrosity?  I know you didnt do that.  When he woke daylight was coming through the glass floor and a boys voice said Oh ... you are in so much trouble.  I am so hotNarcissus said sympathetically.  Well done Frank Zhang Leo said dryly doing his impression of Chiron the centaur.  That is exactly how people beat Chinese handcuffs.  They turn into iguanas.  Leo beamed at his friends.  That good people is how we do things in the Leo World!  Come on in!  I hate Leo World Frank muttered.  Hazel laughed.  Her Most Annoying Majesty Queen of Olympus had convinced the other gods that their two sets of children  Roman and Greek  had to combine forces to save the world from the evil goddess Gaea.  Then he gasped and pointed to the spot where Frank was hiding.  Oh no!  Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin!  Nothing happened.  I said Percy repeated Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin!  Incredible Jason said.  These are really good brownies.  Thats your only comment?  Piper demanded.  The eidolons started pounding on the gates again.  Who is it?  Leo called.  Valdez!  Wolf Head bellowed.  Valdez who?  Leo asked.  Percy smiled at her  that sarcastic troublemaker smile that had annoyed her for years but eventually had become endearing.  His seagreen eyes were as gorgeous as she remembered.  His dark hair was swept to one side like hed just come from a walk on the beach.  He looked even better than he had six months ago  tanner and taller leaner and more muscular.  Frank waved his left dorsal fin.  Sup?  Percy yelled Whats going Gah!  Shrimpzilla!  They were alone expect for Coach Hedge who was back on the quarterdeck singing the Pokemon theme song.  The coach had changed the words to: Gotta Kill Em All and Leo really didnt want to know why.  Behold!  Percy shouted.  The gods chosen beverage.  Tremble before the horror of Diet Coke!  Leo couldnt help smiling.  That could be fun.  Fun she said unhappily.  Blue elephants.  Blue elephants.  Kiss me you fool.  You fool.  Hey!  A son of Ares stood here!  Hedge cried indignantly.  Im Roman ... so Mars actually.  Whatever!  Famous spot in the American Civil War!  Im Canadian actually.  Piper twisted the feather in her hair.  Like water leaking through a dam she suggested.  Yeah.  Percy smiled.  Weve got a dam hole.  What?  Piper asked.  Nothing he said.  Inside joke.  You dropped this he said totally pokerfaced.  Annabeth threw her arms around him.  I love you!  This is Buford Leo announced.  You name your furniture?  Frank asked.  Hazel was looking at him strangely the way she had during the feast in the forumlike she was searching for something in his face.  He was tempted to ask if they had met before but he was sure they hadnt.  He would remember a pretty girl paying such close attention to him.  That didnt happen a lot.  He squinted at it.  What is?  Chinese handcuffs Percy said.  Frank who was Chinese Canadian looked offended.  How is this Chinese?  Hazel and Piper had stopped the shaking fits.  They were sitting on the deck staring at Percy but when he glared at them pointedly they started hamming it up again trembling and flopping around like a fish.  Im the Supersized McShizzle man!  Leo said.  Im Leo Valdez bad boy supreme.  And ladies love a bad boy.,4,False
793, oh  my  gosh  what the heck happened?  so in the cover of the book  The New York Times  says  Brilliant and hugely ambitious.... Its the kind of book that can be LIFE CHANGING  i made a shelf just for this book labelled as lifechanging because honestly it was really life changing.   pages of words from the mouth of death written by  year old liesel meminger was worth it.  im proud to read liesels story because honestly she had a better adeventure than me.  so what i understood from the book: hitlers time nazi germany.  liesel writes down her life called the book thief because she has stolen books her first stealing after her mother and her buried her brother.  liesels mom abandoned her and she now lives with a man who plays the accordion and a woman who swears a lot.  she begins to have a close relationship with a boy whose hair is the color of lemons and a jew who is hiding under the basement.  liesels story is narrated by death.  it is split into ten parts and the titles come from the book titles she read/stolen.  i love all of the characters.  you cannot hate anyone in the book.  i love the figures of speech.  i love that there was a different story to tell in each chapter/part.  i loved the ending the sad sad ending.  what else can i say?  the book was lifechanging in different ways.  i guess its kind of embarrassing to answer why because well...  anyways this book is perfection.  this needs to be a movie i ll cry rivers.,5,False
794, I FINISHED THE BOOK!!  I HOPE TO BUY THE NEXT BOOK TODAY!  So like I have no problems with this book.  No problems.  Actually I stopped reading this series Heroes of Olympus because of Jason.  Hate me all you want.  But I decided to continue with starting with Percy Of Course I read Lost Hero I freaking love Leoand Rick Riordan never fails me with his books.  I like how each character has a role and sort of related to one another.  TEAM LEO!!,5,False

797, I bought it on Saturday.  I finished it on Sunday.  //cries.  OKAY SO WHAT IS BURN FOR BURN?  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS  It is about three different girls oOOoo interesting who plot revenge.  Lillia that girl you see in the popular clique plots revenge on one of her friends Alex because Lillia suspects him for hooking up with her sister.  Kat or Katherine is that girl who smokes and has a broken family.  Shes plotting revenge against Rennie Lillias best friend for they were a trio before and now have broken up because of Rennies lies.  AND Mary is that pretty girl you think is perfect but nope she has a past.  She plotting revenge against Reeve a QB and part of the popular clique.  I like how each character is sort of related to one another and how each character has a role or significance whatsoever.  Did I like the book?  Well it was a pretty light book filled with vengeance and pretty girls who get even and I read it in  hours.  HECK YEAH I LIKED THE BOOK!  Im pretty sure I saw this book in the paranormal section and during the ending of the book I guess I know understand why such high school teen fiction is in the paranormal section.  Guessing  So why did I give this book four stars .... that is because it was SO FAST!  I WANT MORE.  AND WHY WAS LILLIAS REVENGE LONGER THAN MARY AND KATS?  D: Im sorry I dont like Lillia okay.  AND because I hate Lillia this is why the duo authors are great authors!  Making me hate a fiction character and that character is the popular girl I commend you!  Okay so I need a better reason for giving four stars... hmm... lets just look at the bright points!   Personality is shown very well.   Those teacher scenes are not shown and Im happy because sometimes those scenes are sooo boring.   Reallife problems are shown.  well maybe expect for Marys supernatural power or whatever she can do   As I said every character has their own role in the book so no character gets left behind!   THE COVER.  Okay I have know have my dislike list:   Lillia in the cover.  FYI Im Asian Chinese in fact.  Is Lillia suppose to be Chinese?   The ending.  DOES MARY HAVE POWERS OR NOT?   Marys POVs.  Because its so short and Mary is my favorite character.  AND WHEN IT IS LONG THOUGH she talks about her past with Reeve.  smmh.  But I guess thats personality?  Oh well  Lillia  I WOULD SOO read the next book Fire for Fire am I right?  I want the duo to answer my questions:  Is Mary from a family of those supernatural people or something?  What the heck happens to Reeve?  KARMA!  What happens to Alex and Lillia?  When will Rennie finally admit how trashy she is?  Trash coming from Kats words  If Alex and Lillia are hooking up will youauthors make a better sexy character for Kat?  Will Mary ever think about committing suicide again?  Thoughts during the period of reading the book.  I like Mary so far : going to edit this  Wait what  WHY IS MARYS POV SO SHORT?  Oh well I guess thats character personality?  I dont like Lillia at all Im sorry but the cover girl Lillia in the book cover doesnt seem matching.  She looks like a bookworm in the cover.  But I really like that writing.  Im hating on Lillia so much.  Cant she just speak for herself?  Smmh.  //edits two minutes later  I would rather have a Rennie POV then Lillia.  I would like to see a petite woman in the cover.,4,True
798, After three weeks I have finally finished The Raven Boys the first Maggie book I actually finished and Im dancing with joy right now because this book is absolutely amazing.  The Raven Boys is about Blue daughter of a psychic though Blue doesnt have these psychic powers and  boys who go to Aglionby who are branded as raven boys because thats the schools logo.  Ever since she was little Blue has been told that she will kill her true with with a kiss.  And every April th St.  Marks Eve souls of people walk in the corpse road and these people will die within the year.  Blue is shocked to actually see a soul of a person and this person is Gansey who is interested in the corpse road or ley lines and is searching for Glendower.  I like the fact that there was only a pinch of romance I also like the fact that there was brotherly love kidding and parent problems.  I like the fact that I want more of the raven boys all three four of them.  They seem hot and perfect and rich but all of them have their flaws even Ronan  Ladies and gentlemen this book will totally impress you.  It impress me.  During the three weeks I have learned new vocabulary and how awesome magic is.  Im pretty sure there is a second book right?  This book also makes me wonder who Blue will end up with despite her curse and how the book will end.  Also this book has film rights so its not surprising if this book is successful in the movie world.  Ahhh now excuse me Im going to dream about my dream cast.,5,False

801, So Im getting this review from my wordpress.  This review was created on March  :  Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar was published last year and written by Ransom Riggs.  I just finished it minutes ago and I want to review about what I thought about the book.  First of all the story is about Jacob Portman who grew up listening to his grandfathers stories but then several years later as he grew up her began to not believe his fairy tales and treated him like everybody else.  Though one day his grandfather gets attacked by monsters and he tells Jacob to go to a woman named Miss Peregrine.  He discovers the secrets his grandfather never told him before he died and that the fairy tales are real  and they are alive.  The story was a mixed of the ordinary life and the strange life.  For me it was a bit dragging.  The author just didnt go straight to the point.  Jacobs character was not expressed well.  I love all of the characters of this book their talents and the fact that they are really peculiar.  The book is rather dark and fun at the same time.  The book only has  chapters and because of that I was getting bored.  All in all the book was splendid written and peculiar.  I suggest everyone to read this book  OK  months later I can say that this book was not my cup of tea.  The only interesting features about this book are the pictures probably because there are a lot of YA books without pictures.  As I said  months ago it was dragging and I was getting bored.,2,False
802, April   : Wow that suspense  update : April  : After  years Im going to try this book again now that the trilogy just ended a few days ago.  I hope Ill like it more and maybe Ill also get into it.

808, Second read I dropped one star.  I remember how boring and slow the book was but it really picks up at the ending if you can wait that long.  . stars,2,False
809, Im going to read this to finish up my dypstopian book challenge for  but before I even open the book Im going to predict right now that Ky is the person Cassia ends up with.,4,False
810, I remember trying  times to read this but I always gave up on page  or so.  So I skipped to book  and then read the whole series then came back to this book.  Its hard to review this book without taking in the series a as a whole.,3,False
811, This and the whole series Needs a reread.  This was my shit in middle school but all the hate has distorted my views of this book series phenomena really and I need a refresh to form my own opinion.  Thus Ive abstained from rating any books in this series until I reread them again.  Back when I first read them they all would have been  stars.  After I thought it was cool to hate on this theyd be  stars.  The new rating will reflect my current opinion.,0,False
812, The lore in this series is incredible.  I absolutely adore it.  I felt like this book started dragging in the middle and it was completely unnecessary for the book to be  pages.  There are still some loose ends but I enjoyed reading this so.,4,False
813, I enjoyed this book.  It wasnt perfect or innovating and it was kind of predictable.  Still it was a nice read and I enjoyed the story.  I also like how the romance was kind of already established so it wasnt insanely cheesy or cliche or something.,3,False
814, .stars.  Not as good as the first one until the middle end of the book but still good none the less.  The ending is just as vague and infuriating though although that could be me just being dramatic.,4,False
815, . stars.  Took me forever to read this because of college.  I dont know if that affected me or not but once I started reading again after a month things seemed kind of dragged.  It picked up again for a bit.  Some of the decisions that Jacob and Emma made were so annoying and I felt like the ending battle was a bit of a cheap exit.,3,False
816, I LOVE this book.  Originally  I thought this was a horror novel as the title synopsis and cover would suggest.  It turned out to be so much more.  At one point  when Jacob discovers the loop I honestly thought of Narnia   and was a bit deflated and disappointed and didnt know if this book was worth it.  Luckily for me I kept reading and became enthralled mesmerized and enchanted.  It was this beautiful story and I need the second book NOW.  You know a book is good when youre half way through reading it and youre so scared that the book is going to break your heart in the best way possible.,5,True
817, A bunch of science and math jargon that I didnt comprehend but I enjoyed this book.  It was slow at first then picked up.  The humor is sarcastic and dry so its great and funny.  My favorite parts were all then povs other than Marks what can I say?  His are the most boring.,4,False
818, Great read if you want an abridged and slightly inaccurate yet humorous telling of the stories of some Greek heroes.  I was pleasantly surprised to see as many female stories as there were.  Uncle Rick Riordan also includes themes of consent and feminism so good job and kudos to him.  The humor wasnt overbearing like I thought itd be either so yay.  I really enjoyed Otrera Atalanta Cyrene and Orpheuss stories the most.  Also I still hate Jason.  Medeas real story makes her a lot more sympathetic than as was portrayed here but then again I suppose it  was  Jasons story.,4,False
819, Markus Zusak made a post about how he enjoyed this book...must check it out now!,0,False
820, . stars.  It was nice to read this during the holidays because it helped put me in the mood.  Some stories were far superior than others though so the collection wasnt anything amazing.  But then again these types of books rarely are.  Anyways so I started mini reviewing each individual short story but I got lazy for the last  or  so...  Midnights by Rainbow Rowell  . stars  Eh this story was okay.  I thought Noel was o.k.  too.  I will admit that it did suck to read  through watching someones crush constantly kiss everyone but them  The Lady and the Fox by Kelly Link  . stars  I liked this one it was cute if not a little confusing concerning the time period and the ending but maybe thats just me.  Angels in the Snow by Matt de la Pena  . stars  This one grew on me.  I didnt really care for it at first I initially thought  Oh great another biracial story where the white person savior rescues the poor poc  .  Thankfully it wasnt really like that...kindaish Anyways I was smitten by the end of it and I actually cared about the characters.  It was cute.  Polaris is Where Youll Find Me by Jenny Han   stars  Okay first off what??  What was that?!  How are you just going to leave me hanging like that?!  Wheres my closure?  Who am I suppose to root for?  Anyways I wasnt expecting to like this story b/c I didnt like The Summer I Turned Pretty which was written by this author but I actually thought the concept was cool and I love me some Asian representation.  IDK if the authors writing improved or this story was just extremely short so there wasnt much there either way good job.  Its A Yueltide Miracle Charlie Brown by Stephanie Perkins  . stars  This was just cute.  And yay more Asian representation!  I will say though that I can tell a white person wrote this because Most nonAsianAmericans were terrible guessers.  Theyd say Japanese Korean or Vietnamese before Chinese.  Okay stop right there.  As an Asian American I  promise  you that that statement is false.  They  always  assume youre Chinese.  Always .  Your Temporary Santa by David Leviathan  . stars  Eh this was okay.  Didnt really care for it.  Seemed more like an introspection on want and longing rather than a cute Holiday themed short story.  Krampuslauf by Holly Black   stars  I liked it.  We all need friends like Wren.  What the hell have you done Sophie Roth?  by Gayle Forman  . stars  This was my most anticipated story out of the bunch just b/c Gayle Forman is my favorite author from this collection.  So far definitely the best writing.  The story wasnt amazing or anything though.  Beer Buckets and Baby Jesus by Myra Mcentire   stars  Eh didnt like the protagonists voice at first but I acclimated as the story went on.  It was alright.  Welcome to Christmas CA by Kiersten White  . stars  This story was nice if not a bit cheesy at the end.  Star of Bethlehem by Ally Carter  . stars rounded to .  Okay this one caught me by surprise.  The most interesting one for sure and I loved it.  Although the ending was pretty cheesy.  Still I have to say this was my favorite story out of the collection.  The Girl Who Woke the Dreamer by Laini Taylor  . stars  Considering the books that this author wrote I wasnt even surprised to see the story had supernatural elements.  It was alright definitely not a strong enough ending to close out the collection.,3,True
821, Edited //  Welp after reading it a second time I lower my rating from . stars to just  stars.  The beginning was kind of boring and the writing style was just not doing it for.  The end got better though Im still a sucker for Sizzy.  Also I can now say that this whole thing is definitely just a joke and is in no way meant to be taken seriously.  Original Review  . stars...I dont know I enjoyed this story but the dialogue gave me the feeling that this whole thing was just a joke not meant to be taken seriously.,3,False
822, Jeeze this book was one heck of a ride.   stars because there were parts that just seemed to drag along.,4,False
823, . stars.  This was mediocre.  Honestly I enjoyed the movie better.  I also thought both the movie and the book were overrated.  Plus it didnt help that I didnt really like the art style.  Clemetines and Emmas relationship didnt really seem to have much depth to me except for the fact that they were physically and eventually emotionally attracted to each other imo the book doesnt do a good job of showing how their relationship develops and adapts.  The movie does a pretty good job of explaining  Adele/Clementines cheating   than the book does.  The book doesnt explain anything at all.  sigh.,2,True
824, I didnt come into this book expecting much mostly because I was pretty underwhelmed by The Constant Princess which was the only Phillipa Gregory book I had read.  I am happy to say that this book was amazing.  I really loved the writing and the story was so interesting!  There was nonstop political intrigue it was almost overwhelming.  Luckily I love political intrigue.  I also loved the protagonist Elizabeth Woodsville and I had a love/hate relationship with Edward.  So much happened in this book I felt like I read a novels worth of plot just in the first  pages alone.  I tried to put off finishing this book because I didnt want it to end!  Im dying to read another book in this series I cant wait.,5,False
825, . stars.  I began this book with high expectations I mean it won the Pulitzer Prize!  It has to be good then right?  Thankfully it was.  The abrupt chapters and switching povs was offputting at first but it grows on you and really works later on in adding tension and suspense.  The first half of the book started slow I had to push myself to read through the beginning.  The book picks up though as you begin to read further and begin to understand what this book actually is: Its a book about war and I thought it was incredibly interesting to have a point of view from the French resistance and a point of view from a German boy brainwashed and forced to fight a war.  Yes there is a villain in this book but it was mostly just a story about living through a war.  I think the book becomes incredibly enjoyable when you accept that the story is just about the lives of certain characters and how everything can be connected.  I felt like the book was specifically written to be poignant but I wasnt entirely convinced.  This book wasnt perfect but I read  pages in one day and stayed up until am to finish it and I felt utterly affected by it at the end and that says something.  It doesnt hurt that I was listening to some brilliant music and became swept up into a wistful state which certainly just enhanced my experience while reading this book.,5,False
826, Stopped reading this at page .  I dont know if its just the mood Im in or what but I could not get into this at all.  Disappointing.,1,False
827, Surprisingly a lot of the dialogue from the movie were direct quotes from the book.  Truly one of the most true adaptations of a book Ive seen in a movie.  It was enjoyable but I feel like watching the movie first made me enjoy the book less since I already knew what was going to happen.,3,False
828, Fast read.  I like but am also a bit unbalanced by the way Mr.  Abercrombie tells his story without a   happy ending.  Because those endings while almost always the case for most media probably arent that realistic and common as were made to believe.   stars isnt bad in fact I feel like this book was better than some other books Ive rated  stars.  But for me there just isnt that umph to push the rating to  stars or even ..  I enjoyed the book but thats about it.,3,True
829, Digging the cover.  Might check this book out.,0,False
830, DNF.  I got about half way before I lost interest in this book.  I really enjoyed the writing and the beginning was most enjoyable imo.  This had some pretty outrageous moments but I believe thats part of its charm.  Maybe one day Ill pick it back up and finish it but I am way too behind in my reading challenge to try and force myself to finish a book Im not interested in anymore.,3,False
831, I tried reading this.  Honest.  I did.  The cover is nice the title is nice the premise is interesting and overall it seems like a nice young adult romance novel that I can sink my teeth in so to speak after having been in a reading slump since June  I still am actually.  But yeah everything that I just mentioned?  All misleading.  I couldnt do it.  Why?  Because the writing sucks.  Seriously it sucks.  How does someone write like that and get published?  Ive read fanfiction that was more wellwritten than this.  Harsh but true.  Examples of the writing if you can stomach this then you can get through this book unlike moi:  Ethan isnt a typical teen rock star.  His music has a quality and depth that boy bands typically lack.  You can totally hear influences in his music...Ethan believes that they were the musicians who made music what it is today...Ethans musical style is hard to describe.  He has a unique sound no one else has ever created before.  Even though his music is so original its tone is familiar.  His songs somehow relate to everyone.  They just feel like home...  etc.  etc.,1,False
832, The synopsis and the cover make this seem like a plain old cliche YA retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  Not true and very misleading.  It was so much more.  There were moments were I was like WHAT?!,5,False
833, Based off just the title and without reading the synopsis this book wasnt what I was expecting.  I still enjoyed it however and it was a pretty quick read.  Very enlightening in terms or dealing with autism and family dynamics.,3,False
834, Did someone say steam punk?  Count me in.,0,False
835, I just finished the book and Im still reeling from it.  The book was going along great until the ending.  It was such a sucker punch.  I dont see how anybody could have seen it coming because its one of those plot twists that feel like a cheap shot.  I have two conflicting emotions right now: on one hand I want to burn this stupid book and on the other I want the third book NOW.  Ugh but there were so many things about the ending that bugged me.  Okay how old is Miss Wren?  HOW COULD SHE HAVE BEEN SO FUCKING STUPID?  Seriously?!  She trusted that asshat to call off his men!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  How unrealistic honestly.  And why the fuck did Brownwyn I forgot how to spell her name hold back Jacob and Emma and let Caul kill Althea??!  Seriously.  .,4,True
836, . stars.  I liked this book!  It started off kind of slow for my taste but nonetheless it was still enjoyable.  There wasnt really any action but I did like the writing style.  Things were too convenient for my taste but wow there were SO MANY cute moments in this book.  Like I had to stop and just appreciate all the feels that I got from how cute it was.  sigh/swoon.  Also some parts where I was just like OH MY GOSH!  I see how he set that up!  GENIUS!  Just watched the movie and Im not sure which one I liked better.  Im leaning towards the book but the ending of the movie was so dang cute!,3,False
837, Umm wow.  I havent enjoyed a short story this much since The Audition...Okay this definitely attracted my attention.,4,False
838, . stars the first half of the book set up the story and it kind of dragged but the second part of the book is where the story shines especially when other characters besides Victor and Eli are introduced.  Seriously the supporting cast was what saved this book.  I love Sydney Mitch and Serena.  I dont really think superhero is a good word to use when describing this book in any way but I see how it plays into Elis character.  I do like how neither Victor nor Eli can be categorically placed into good vs bad or hero vs villan which is definitely one of the themes the author was trying to get across with this book yet the reader still somehow comes to pick a side and root for that character as if he were the hero which I guess in terms of this story he is.  The concept of ExtraOrdinary people and their powers is really interesting  I especially like the idea that whatever the person focuses on the most right before they die correlates to the power that they develop when theyre brought back.  .  I like the ending although I really want to see what happens next.,3,True
839, . stars.  The movie would definitely give me nightmares.,3,False
840, . stars.  Man this book can be pretty depressing...,3,False
841, It started off slow and it didnt really go anywhere until near the end.  The romance was predictable and some twists were o.k.,3,False
842, I originially rated this  stars but thinking back on this book I cant remember anything about it except that it was pretty boring so rating has been dropped to  stars  Original Review  It was okay I guess.  Hayley was pretty irritating and boy was she BITTER.  Finn was alright he was one of those eccentric young adult male love interests cough Augustus cough.  I dont really know whether or not I actually liked this book or not...,1,False
843, . stars?  If I were to describe this book in one word Id say disappointed.  I feel like I should give this book  stars because I didnt really enjoy it on the other hand its not bad per say.  The plot twist that everyone is raving about didnt even surprise me.  I had already deduced something similar several chapters back.  Oh well.,1,False
844, . stars rounded up to .  I devoured this book.  The writing was gorgeous and the book was very atmospheric and had this supernatural/eerie sense to it at least imo throughout.  Unforunately I thought the last / or even / of the book was rather lackluster I give the first half of the book  stars and the last / like maybe . stars  the ending also left me feeling unsatisfied but because I enjoyed the previous parts so much I decided to round my rating up to  stars instead of .  I have the distinct feeling that not much actually happened in this book but the characters and the setting and mood were just so well written I didnt really care.  I look forward to reading the Goldfinch.,5,False
845, This book wasnt as bad as other books Ive rated  star but unfortunately I did not enjoy this book at all.  The problem?  It was so damn BORING.  Holy shit.  Ive read  previous books by this author and I more or less liked them but this was just crap.  What was the point of the story?  Maybe it was so boring because of the child narrator but I dont think that was the problem.  This book just seemed pointless it didnt really have a story worth telling  or reading for that matter.,1,False
846, I loved it.  But I think thats because I watched the movie a day before I read the book.  Watching the movie beforehand helped me appreciate the novella.  And Audrey Hepburn .,5,False
847, I love a good mythology book.,0,False
848, . stars rounded up to  because Goodreads has yet to add half stars...seriously...I loved this book.  It was a great fantasy book and the romance is so cute subtle and intimate yet at the same time tasteful it made me feel like I was intruding.  The only flaw that initially comes to mind and stands to me though is the pacing.  Just the journey took up most of the book and the final confrontation was kind of short.  Also I think she could have added more depth to the characters besides Taisin and Kaede.  Anyhow I am falling in love with Ms.  Los writing.  I became a fan of her when I read her story in Foretold and Im excited to read more books by her.,5,False
849, . stars.  This book is definitely the most realistic lesbian book that Ive ever read.  The relationship felt very real and organic and I love how one of the main conflicts was the inner conflict of this is wrong but it feels so right kind of thing.  Liza the main character lives during a time when homosexuality was not accepted AT ALL yet shes still brave enough to follow her feelings.  Her bravery isnt inyourfacetellingnotshowing rather its very subtle and I loved that.  At times mostly near the end I noticed the book was kind of preachy as in the author obviously telling the overall theme/life lesson through dialogue through the characters which I know is in a lot of books but I felt maybe the author was trying a bit too hard.  Anyways although I cant relate personally I can VERY easily see that this book is incredibly relatable and I think everyone needs to read this at least once.,4,False
850, This book was a pretty quick read.  It was very dialogue heavy and it didnt really have a plot.  I was about / of the way through an thought about giving up because it was pretty boring but I decided to force myself to finish it because of all the awards it had and the high rating.  I dont think I really got Ari until the end maybe thats why the book wasnt very enjoyable for me.  But the book definitely picked up near the very end  when Dante got beat up :/  .  And I have to admit the ending was pretty cute.  Still this book took until the end to start making sense for me and if it takes a book that long I dont think its worth it.  One thing I actually really liked was Aris relationship with his mom the banter was everything.  Overall this book just wasnt for me.,2,True
851, Eh.  Took me about a month to read this.  Honestly I was sort of uninterested.  It MIGHT have been because Id just finish playing the Last of Us.  Quite frankly I think that the story works better in video game form.,2,False
852, Hmm...Tilt then Triangle and now maybe Tangled?,0,False
853, Well where do I even start.  Lets start off with the fact that I came into this book completely blind I had no idea what this book was about.  In fact for some reason I had this notion that this book was going to be about mental illness.  So seeing as how I came into this book knowing nothing about it imagine my surprise when I started reading it and I read nonsense.  Turns out this book is filled with a made up language based off of Russian slang.  I saw some reviews praising the author for making the slang accessible and easy to follow and learn.  All I have to say about that is speak for yourself.  I had no idea how to read this and I was barely getting along until I finally looked up a glossary and memorized a few of the more commonly used words.  Besides the difficulty I faced in reading this book I guess I just dont get it.  The ultraviolence turned me off which I guess was the point however I know a lot of people felt sorry for Alex and what he went through well not me.  Im not saying he deserved  everything  he got but he deserved a lot of it.  He was a borderline psychopath who got off on violence and being an overall shitty human being.  I have no sympathy for what he went through.  I think what made me lose any and all compassion I might have had for him is when he  got two  year old girls drunk brought them home then raped them.  I dont get the theme warning about government control and whatever  maybe they crossed the line but its hard to care when the only example of that were showed is what happened to Alex.  Overall I thought this book sucked.  I almost gave up after page  but I powered through thinking about all the good reviews on goodreads.  In hindsight I should have just read wikipedia.  This book was a real pain in the ass to read.  If anyone wants to try and explain to me whatever Im not seeing thatd be nice.  Cant say Id agree with you though.,1,True
854, props to whoever designed these covers cause honestly Im in love...with the covers that is.  Also maybe this series :.  Usually I get sick of that cliche love triumphs over all kind of romance but I think Im o.k.  when it comes to this series.,5,False
855, I cant believe this is suppose to be a childrens book...it was creepy as hell and I honestly dont know how I feel about it.  The book was weird and the ending sucked but it wasnt bad and it was interesting.  Honestly the book feels incomplete but apparently theres a sequel that the author wrote like  years later so.  Basically this is a dystopian novel thats hella weird yet it sucks you in but then feels incomplete and unfinished at the end.,4,False
856, PostReading  I would just like to say that I called it.  I CALLED IT.  I knew  Ares was the big bad god trying to control Seth   Also I thought it was annoying how the author wrote like  sex scenes in this book.  Like I get it enough already!  Good Lord so  Aidan hates himself for putting Alex on the elixir and punishes himself by avoiding her?  So....like Dimitri when he hates himself for the things he did to Rose as a Strigoi?  SMH...,4,True
857, Okay so I basically read this book in one day.  I have mixed feelings about it  enjoyed it  felt iffy about it.  On one hand I absolutely adored the sarcastic and snarky tone/moments because I am incredibly sarcastic.  Plus Lucy loved slaying zombies online?  I can relate.  Maybe not to that extent but still none the less.  I loved the suspense of trying to figure out the two mysteries.  Once they were revealed however it was a bit of a let down.  Also the ending kind of bugged me and just how things were handled like I was suppose to learn this great lesson after reading this book.  Still I couldnt put it down.,4,False
858, HAH!  I knew it!  I predicted that  Seth would turn on Alex and become power hungry etc.  AND that Leon was Apollo!  Either Im too good or the author needs to cool it with the hints.  Anyways I LOVED this book!  Damn it if people say its like Vampire Academy!  Theyre both great series and I cannot wait to read books  and !,5,True
859, Liked this better than the first book.  This is speculation since I havent read the rd book yet if the author makes it so Seth was actually just using her I will be angry because I HATE when authors do that.  I hate when they take a seemingly sweet genuine guy and turns him into a douche so the reader will root for the other guy.  UGH.,5,False
860, . stars.  This book was heartwrenching.  And yes I related to Fern.  I didnt really like Rans mantra though I mean what twelve year old says that?  Plus a lot of things were left unexplained.  I wish Ms.  Knowles had gone more in depth.  She definitely only scratched the surface.  This is the second book I have read and loved.  I cannot wait to read her other books!,4,False
861, Love the show on Netflix hopefully the book will be good too.,0,False
862, I liked it.  Just like the first book there was a plot twist that I didnt see coming.  Yet again though I felt like this book didnt really have any substance in it until near the end.  Also the author  never fully explained Addies time slowing ability.  Like um.  Okay.  I guess its there because it just is and also to advance the plot  .  So yeah.  Theres that.,4,True
863, I liked this book but I was disappointed at how short it was compared for the first book.  There was some more world building in here that I really enjoyed but I wish there was more.  I felt like this book was lacking in substance compared to the first book too.  I mean if GotG had too much crammed in there then this book definitely had too little.  I liked Justin and Maes development but I was kind of put off by  Maes rape  .  The ending however literally made me go What?!  out loud.  And it really explains the aforementioned spoiler better.  Maes much more likable at least to me in this book.  I thought Tessas scenes were tedious and boring compared to Justin and Maes povs however.  Interesting to see where the plot goes in the third book hopefully there will be more world building!,4,True
864, Hmm  stars.  This book started off pretty good.  Sadly it had to go down that certain path  surprise!  the guy is an extremely irresistible hundred of years old vampire who is antisocial for the greater good of courseand is immediately mysteriously drawn to the main character who then turns into a stuttering constantly horny and blushing fool whenever she is around him.  sigh And even if hes dangerous and warns her away she is still attracted to him and blah blah blah love complication breakup and make up repeat.  Ugh.  I hate how the MC becomes an idiot when a guy is involved.  And I seriously cant get over the fact Ms.  Cook had to make him a vampire.  I mean A VAMPIRE.  This is like Twilight all over again.  .  I mean you might be into this stuff but I was annoyed.  I literally put the book down after the first plot twist and I was about to go and return it to the library right then and there without finishing it.  Alas in the end I finished it and it was alright nothing remarkable or original really.  Not sure if I should bother to check out the rest of the series...,3,True
865, So much happened in this book.,5,False
866, UGH.   release date??  WHY.  SO CHAOL CAN GET HIS OWN BOOK?  Im obviously the only one here but I give zero fucks about Chaol.  Hes such an asshole.,0,False
867, .  stars Hazzah!  I finished!  Had to read this book and answer questions for AP English.  For the most part this book was boring imo and is pretty hard to understand.  However there were some partsthat I ACTUALLY understood... that were REALLY clever and I just had to chuckle out loud while reading them!  Jim is by far the best character in the book!  Even if I didnt understand what he was saying sometimes...,3,False
868, . stars.  Okay so it wasnt perfect the ending was unsatisfying and anticlimactic really makes me want to know what the sequels are about.  And this book was darker than I expected.  Oh and Im also suppose to believe an  year old kid and his siblings are super geniuses...yeah sure.  Anyways the action was great and I really liked the writing.  So my stupid exclassmate spoiled this book for me.   you.,5,False
869, . stars Wow!  That ending!  Makes it want to smack someone with the book!  Talk about a cliffhanger...This book was good.  At first I was a bit confused about the changing povs but you get used to it pretty soon.  This book made me so confused and then made me have a huge epiphany thanks to the characters explanations.  Also Im pretty sure I fell in love with Evan like Cassie did.  What I dont like is that this book has HUGE case of instalove.  Bleh.,4,False
870, Okay so shit didnt go down until the very end of the book.  I did enjoy reading the book but I have to admit that not much happened.  Honestly the witch Manons point of view felt boring and pointless to me.  Seriously I didnt care about her and no doubt shell have a bigger role in the story but oh my god it was annoying to read about her pov and have practically nothing happen.  Chaol still annoys me and my poor baby Dorian :.  I felt like this book dragged a bit but I think its quite nice to actually read about training happening instead of just reading a sentence referring to a characters training and then the character being a BAMF right away.  Hopefully Queen of Shadows moves the plot along more than this book did which shouldnt be hard since this book just felt like a setup/filler.,4,False
871, Really strong debut book.  It never got boring and I cant wait for McGinnis next book.,4,False
872, Cover reminds me of that stock photo that was used as Talis Face from ME,0,False
873, And with this book I complete my  challenge goal of reading  books written by male authors!  Hazzah!  PostReading  . stars...not sure to make it a  or  on the star thingy....  I dont know if its just me but I thought this book really started off slow.  I was around page  and I was still pretty bored and I was about to just turn it in to the library without finishing it.  i kept reading and I admit that it got better though some cases were still boring.  I was kind of confused about a couple of things and had questions still and in the end some of them still dont get answered.  And the characters... not much character development for any character imo obviously besides Michael and sheesh I could not get a read on Holly or Japekwhatever his name is.  Seriously Holly is on Michaels side one instance then shes not the other and with no explanation!  There were a couple plot twists but I felt like the author was trying to hard to confuse the reader.  To make them think one thing only to have it be something else entirely except he didnt really pull it off in a clever way just confusing and unnecssary.  Seriously so many twists in this book that were trying too hard and I was just annoyed/confused.,3,True
874, Hmm.  I liked this book but the pace definitely isnt for everyone.  For the most part nothing huge or big or terribly exciting happens.  And it just seemed too convenient for me when  Camerons childhood friend and swimmer friend just happen to also be lesbian?  .  Also the ending was terrible.  It was so anticlimactic and basically NOTHING was resolved.  Nothing.  And I hate endings like that.,3,True
875, Read this years ago but Im pretty sure I cried at the ending...,5,False
876, I love this book.  I need to go buy it now.  This book is about the horrors of the Holocaust yes but it also shows how even when it seems like no one has their humanity anymore there areand always will be people who have hearts and show compassion.  Who are human.  This book is filled with sadness yet also with hope.  With loss but also with happiness.  Look to the helpers in times of tragedies you will always find people who are helping.  It amazes me how Ilse and the other girls have practically nothing yet they constantly give to Gerda.  Like Ilse had that one raspberry she found and instead of eating it she gave it to Gerda.  Also Frau Kugler.  Amazing how much compassion and heart she had.  Seriously.  It amazes and inspires me to see how much humanity people had during times of despair.  I phrased my feelings horribly but I think if you read this book then youll understand,5,True
877, . stars.  I liked it but Im not sure what I read.  What was the purpose of the book?  The theme?  Is it satire?  Okay so I looked at some reviews and stuff and my original idea is confirmed.  This book is about existentialism and the meaning of life as well as what makes us a human being.  The beginning started off really slowly but for what its worth by the end of the book I started thinking.  And I think thats exactly what the author intended.,3,False
878, This book was actually better than I expected.  I didnt want to get my hopes up for fear that this book would suck even though it had high ratings a la TFiOS thankfully that was not the case.  I actually really liked the writing and I liked the characters and the dynamics.  Im glad for the Asian representation even if Park is only half Asian.  Personally I felt like the first half of the book was better than the second half.  Im not quite sure that I understand Eleanor at the end but oh well.  I was able to read this book in about a day give or take so its a pretty quick read.  I didnt really feel anything at the ending so Im not quite sure what the author was aiming for...maybe a bittersweet ending?  But honestly it didnt have to be.  Im not saying it should have been a happily ever after thing but I dont really agree with a characters actions in the end and I kind of feel like they acted that way just so the ending would be bittersweet.  The romance got a little cliche and eyeroll inducing at times when the author was being poetic or poignant but other than that it was pretty solid and cute.  Also if anyone could tell me whether or not they ever had sex thatd be great.  Im still a bit confused  I dont think they did but I mean if Im wrong please correct me  .,4,True
879, . stars.  The beginning was pretty confusing and it took me a while to get used to the italic writing.  I wish the author just decided on one point of view instead this book is written in both first person and in third person.  Honestly the synopsis just explains the whole book.  The book wasnt really what I was expecting Arthur didnt even die until the middle of the book and those seven years of hardship were literally just skimmed over.  I just skimmed the ending because I didnt feel like reading pages worth of italics.,3,False
880, . stars.  Man can this guy write.,4,False
881, . stars.  What I liked about this book particularly was the psychology and Kaysens scenes with her fellow patients.,4,False
882, So I kind of already knew where the book was going pretty much since the beginning so it was kind of predictable.  Although I didnt exactly predict Conors truth.  I enjoyed the little fairytale stories and how they get across the theme of not everythings black and white the stories were such a creative way of telling it.  I dont know I didnt really feel anything special until probably the ending.  I know a bunch of people are raving in their reviews about this book about how maybe they got chills or something.  The book just seemed a bit underwhelming to me until the ending the ending is what gave me a glimpse of that feeling of awe ?  that everyone else seemed to feel the entire book.  I would recommend this book to someone.  I feel like this one of those books where I would appreciate it even more if I reread it.  Also the illustrations in this book kicked ass.  A quality.,3,False
883, Hm I have to say not my favorite Agatha Christie book.  What this book did extremely well was create tension and suspense.  I couldnt put the book down and I was just as terrified and confused as the victims in the story.  I was constantly wondering who would die next and who was committing the murders.  Im not giving this  stars because the big reveal kind of disappointed me in that its a classic case of possible but not really probable.  I suppose it makes sense for the killer to be who it is.  Also Ill pat myself on the back for having an idea of where this was going  Since the first murder of Marston I had the idea that the killer would pretend to be killed off so they would be free of suspicion.  Of course I thought maybe it was Marston because he was the first to go but alas I was wrong.  .  If anything this book is a quick enjoyable read that will keep you on the edge of your seat.,4,True
884, Interesting and wellwritten nonetheless even if you disagree with Ayn Rands philosophy.,4,False
885, I want to read this book especially since I heard the second book is even better but I just saw that Sarah J. Maas is turning this into a book series instead of a trilogy and the last book is slated for release in ... Im gonna wait a bit because Im sure itll be torture to wait.,0,False
886, Man oh man.  I dont even know what to say about this book.  So many things...,5,False
887, For once the relationship between a student and teacher isnt just black and white.  Let me tell you its a VERY very prominent gray.,5,False
888, I get that this book contains fantasy elements but there were just some parts that felt plain unrealistic to the point of absurdity.  The writing wasnt too bad minus some parts but whatever.  The pacing was bad and the plot was thin.  There were so many unanswered questions.  I almost gave up on the book near the middle.,2,False
889,   . stars...um wow.  This book went from lighthearted to heavy/actionactionactionaction and the main characters life went from pretty awesome to complete SHIT in like  short chapters....The book was kind of slow at first and it didnt really go anywhere but near the middleend emphasis on end it JUMPS into action NONSTOP for the rest of the book...  This is a series?  Well damn guess the feels are just gonna be rolling along  eh I hate how the author made Duke from a nice guy to a complete dick wad and Trevor into mr.  perfect.  I knew that would happen since before even reading the book from when I just read the synopsis.  Ive read wayyy too many books where the author turns one of the guys into a dick head so it gives the main character an excuse to fall in love with the right guy,4,False
890, This is why kids dont like to read.,1,False
891, Since the first book fell flat I was expecting the same from the sequel.  In the beginning it was just that.  By the middle though I was thoroughly enraptured by the book.  It was VERY predictable and I predicted the villains since practically the beginning still that fact did not diminish my enjoyment of the book.,4,False
892, excuse my excessive use of the Fword in this review/rant/drabbleofthoughts  . stars.  Okay.  This book was a pretty solid  stars until the ending.  I mean if you read this book for what it is youll really enjoy it.  What it is is a nice easy mindless chicklit book.  Its a fast easy read full of fluff and light teenage angst.  So I accepted that fact and I really enjoyed the book.  The writing made me chuckle sometimes out loud but there were also times where I thought it was pretty cheesy even for a chicklit and wondered if a guy really acted that way or would say that.  Usually books with characters like these just annoy the crap out of me but somehow when Lauren Barnholdt writes them its okay.  Now lets move on to the ending/my rant.  Seriously this book went from a solid  stars to /. stars.  I mean Id give the ending itself  stars.  Obviously I said not to expect much from this book but I seriously expected more than what it is.  Let me explain.  Jace and Peyton hook up for one day but its this crazy out of this world amazing day.  Then they talk and whatnot.  Then one day Jace stops talking to her and therefore breaks up with her even though they technically werent even dating.  And its like Jace and Peyton still arent over each other cue eye roll and somehow they end up on this sorta kinda road trip together.  Oh and you find out they broke up because of this secret that Peyton kept from Jace...prepare for the ranting It will most definitely contain spoilers so...  It turns out the secret that Peyton kept from Jace was that her parents were getting a divorce.  What.  The.  Actual.  Fuck.  Okay heres where I have a problem with this book.  I was willing to overlook the fact that Peyton and Jace are unrealistically obsessed with each other after one day but I will not overlook this.  Like SERIOUSLY?  THATS WHY HE WAS PISSED OFF AT HER?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Well first off Jace considering you guys only went on one date its no fucking wonder she didnt tell you  that her parents were getting a divorce  .  She barely fucking knows you.  She didnt even tell ANYONE yet not even her best friend or close family members and you fucking expect her to tell you something that personal?!  It obviously must devastate her.  Why the fuck would you feel like she was obligated to tell you?  It wasnt even a secret in a sense.  It was her not ready to fucking share everything with you.  Thats so fucking stupid.  If that was me Id tell the guy to fuck off.  Not like I owe it to him to tell him something thats personal and none of his business especially if Ive only known him for a few months.  Also Peyton was just so stupid.  Why the fuck she didnt tell her dad or anyone that  her mom stole her identity   is beyond me.  Yeah I get it.  that sucks.  It was out of nowhere and how the hell do you confront a parent?  But seriously your dad is a fucking option!  HELLO?!  I mean yeah take some time to digest it but completely doing nothing about it and running away is just ridiculous.  How old is she again?  And Jordan giving that advice to Jace?  Do teenage guys even think like that?  And Jace and Peytons povs sounded really similar.  There are plenty more things to complain about but I think itll just take all day.  I gave TwoWay Street a similar book by the same author  stars because I read it years ago when I was much younger and my tastes were not yet as mature and refined as they are now pfft hahahahahaha.  yeah right.  like I can actually use the words mature and refined to describe myself.  Probably more accurate to say Ive slightly matured from preteen to young adult teen and therefore now enjoy deeper reads.I still enjoy chicklit every now and then though.   and the book was easy to read I started and finished it on a Saturday morning but Im pretty sure if I reread it now the rating would go down.  Still if you read the book for what it is and arent expecting anything above superficiality then youll be able to enjoy the book.  Plus there were a lot of things that didnt have closure.  Also why the heck even have B.J.  in the book?  And that scene with Jaces mom.  Talk about cheesy and unrealistic.  Also the cameos with Courtney and Jordan seemed to be there just so they would have a cameo in the book.  Lame.,3,True
893, This book started off great.  Then it went down the drain and I just wanted someone to stake all the characters because they were so DAMN annoying.  This review sums it up best: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...,3,False
894, Really liked this book and while I see the similarities to Vampire Academy I feel like VA had more charm.  Still this book was kind of predictable but I really liked it.,4,False
895, Um.  Can I have the second book now?  Pretty please?  Seriously this was the first book in MONTHS that I have read in less than a day.  It was just that compelling and interesting.  Cant wait for the next book!,5,False
896, I really enjoyed this book!  It started off slow but then I think near the middle it just picked up for me and I zipped through the rest of the book.  It became hard to put down.  When I first started reading this book the writing reminded me of Libba Brays Beauty Queens and this book definitely came off as chicklit to me since the very beginning not a bad thing.  The writing made me chuckle and smile and while that was sort of embarrassing because sometimes it was in public I love it when a book/any writing can make me do that.  This book is charming I think Im beginning to understand how a book can be described as charming and witty and made me laugh because of the writing.  And by the end of the book I had a huge smile plastered on my face and it made me feel good.  And gosh darn the struggle Francesca and her mother had with their dads really hit home...,4,False
897, First read this freshman year of high school and just read it again for my writing class nd year of college.,4,False
898, Sigh Boy was I disappointed from this book...I was expecting this book to be amazing because it has a pretty high rating honestly I should have learned my lesson from TFiOS and that some reviewers that I follow have praised and lauded Ms.  Stiefvaters other books.  So I obviously expected this book to be amazing.  I was wrong.  It was boring lackluster and plain.  First off the pacing.  Literally nothing NOTHING happens in this book.  Oh you can argue with that point but whatever.  I first realized that nothing happened at around page  when Puck had FINALLY decided to register in the race on her regular horse.  Its ridiculous that it took that long.  Why?  Because its unnecessary and BECAUSE ITS EXPLAINED IN THE SYNOPSIS.  Ugh.  Such a bad move.  Then I read  more pages and I got near the end when finally FINALLY the race actually started.  ...Are you kidding me?  The WHOLE book is superficial and composed of NOTHING.  Seriously!!  I get it the men discriminate against you Puck because youre a girl.  I understood that concept the first time it happened.  No need to shove it in my face every chapter.  You and Sean have this crazy love for horses that no one else apparently understands.  Gotcha.  Oh yeah and its a BIG deal because youre the first/only girl to decide to do this.  Yeah I GOT THE MEMO.  The idea that a girl takes the first initiative to end something that has long time been a male dominated activity used to be original but now its become cliche expected even!  The author literally could have written this book in like  pages or less.  Seriously.  Also the reason that Puck joined the races is incredibly stupid and shallow.  Seriously?  Its not believable enough for me.  The author writes this book in alternating point of views.  Puck and Sean.  A.k.a.  the female protagonist who is defying gender roles blah blah blah not that thats not important but the way it was written was quite honestly lame and the male love interest oh please thats not even a spoiler.  Seriously did anyone NOT expect them to get together?  because youve got to add a little romance in here sarcasm.  My main complaint with this style choice is that the tone of the povs ARE EXACTLY THE SAME.  Sean and Puck sound exactly.the.same.  I shit you not Im not even exaggerating or anything.  I swear.  Honest.  I mean if youre going to write multiple povs you HAVE to write them so theyre different from one another I think Rick Riordan is a GREAT example of this.  His characters in the HoO series while not all likable at least to me definitely all have unique voices.  Its practically impossible to get them mixed up.  Seriously its only two characters!  You seriously couldnt create two different personalities?  I mean theres this one page where Sean remarks on how handsome this American guy is another thing the author created this world and decided to incorporate it somehow with reality.  Its weird and awkward at least for me.  Do guys even do that?  I did enjoy the ending but it definitely DOES NOT make up for reading a whole book worth of nothing.  The ending while pleasing isnt even surprising either.  Its expected.  Not good.  This book unfortunately lacks originality.  It falls into that youngadultbook category I cant think of the word right now.  Yknow when all young adult books seem to follow this pattern?  Boymeetsgirl or vice versa and they bond and they get together at the end and everything works out happily ever after after stumbling over a few conflicts here or there.  I cant articulate myself right now but...yeah.,1,False
899, Classical musician and badboy guitar player?  Does this sort of remind anyone else of If I Stay?  update Just finished the book and okay seriously?  Cello?!  Now it REALLY reminds me of If I Stay oh and the coma part too!?  Anyways this book was cute but was filled with cliches,3,False
900, . stars rounded down to  susceptible to change because I JUST finished the book  minutes ago and am still reeling from it.  I need time to properly assess my thoughts and feelings about this book because the book took a while to really capture my attention but when it did I simply could not put it down.  This book was creepy.  It was weird disturbing surreal bizarre insane and just plain creepy.  It started off kind of slow but I eventually warmed up to the narration/writing style and things definitely got interesting REALLY interesting.  Every single character is creepy.  At first it seemed as though Camille was the only sensible one but then  she sleeps with John   and she became as creepy and sad as everyone else.  I cant imagine anyone acting these ways like everyone in the book does in real life.  While reading I always had this feeling that something was off about the book.  The ending was wow.  Im pretty sure I said What the fuck?!  at least  times while reading this book.  Im craving more from Ms.  Flynn!  Also I learned A LOT of new words that are great additions to my vocabulary so thank you!  Thinking about buying this book and adding it to my personal library.  I really want to give this  stars but...idk...,4,True
901, One of the best books in the series I think.,5,False
902, This one definitely wasnt as good as the second one.  Not much happened really.,3,False
903, Welp we can all agree Nikki is a bitch.,4,False
904, This book is all about female empowerment while also tackling many subjects such as racism stereotyping and sexuality.  Seriously it covers EVERYTHING.  Feminism ftw.  I like how it doesnt take itself too seriously though.,4,False
905, I truly enjoyed this book.  Tina Fey is funny but thats nothing new.,4,False
906, . stars rounded up to .  So I had high expectations coming into this book and the beginning was kind of slow but Id say my expectations were surpassed.  I was surprised to find out that this book had multiple povs not just August a.k.a.  Auggie our protagonist and main character.  Those other povs turned out to be my favorite part of the book.  It was a very clever addition that worked out because the other povs give us insight in how other people perceive Augusts facial deformities.  It works so well because the author was spot on in her characterization of the characters.  Their thoughts and their actions were  accurate/realistic and completely reflect how kids and even adults would act or think.  Honestly reading this transported me back to when I was in elementary school and I honestly emphasize so much.  I was definitely one of those kids who didnt partake in bullying but I wouldnt stand up for the person either Im ashamed to say.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy this book and the message resonates no matter how old one may be.  Everyone should be reminded of the message of this book and I genuinely think if I ever have a child/children Im going to give them this book to read.  I honestly teared up like twice throughout this book but Im a big sap so.  Also the book I was reading had an extra Julian chapter and while I think it was a nice touch it wasnt as resonating or good as the main book imo but maybe Im being too harsh.,5,False
907, ..DAFUQ?  Ill have graduated college by then and probably have a career...Actually my main concern is that he might die before he finishes the series...,0,False
908, . stars.  The first / of the book I loved.  For some reason the last / didnt seem as exciting it might have been due to the fact that I was rushing to finish this book in a week which I did.  Anyways what I loved so much about this book was that there was so much political intrigue and definitely some gamechanging reveals  Aegon Targaryen is alive?  Holy shit!  If it comes down to him or Daenerys taking the throne I want Dany all the way.  .  Also Daenerys was a BAMF as usual Jon Snow was actually interesting for once Tyrion was witty as always  apparently Arya can see again   the povs from nonmain characters were actually well done and less boring and there was no Sam and barely any Bran so yay for that.  I wished we caught up with Sansa.  Again though I have doubts that George RR Martin can wrap up this series in  more books without it feeling rushed cheap or filled with a shit ton of plot holes.  A large part is due to the snails pace of the story.  Seriously after the first book its been  books of gradual slooooooowww buildup of the plot and weve still yet to reach the climax.  Anyways hope the th book comes out within a year or .  Until then I can finally start bingewatching the show now that Ive caught up with the books.,5,True
909, . stars.  Theres a lot of sex and rape in this book way more than in Game of Thrones from what I remember.  The book started off pretty slow the whole thing just felt like  pages of setup/filler with a very small foray into the introduction of magic barely building upon what was introduced in GOT.  The slow pacing of the book and the fact that it seemed like there were a lot of words but not a lot happening makes me want to just start watching the show books be damned.  Honestly the only reason Im going to continue reading the series is the sole reason that its GOT if it were any other series I would just stop here.  Also I felt like Tyrion had more than half of the povs in the book definitely way more than any other character.  Tyrions a cool and interesting character but I was getting a little tired of reading through his povs because he just had so many.,2,False
910, Oh man this book was SO much better than the second one.  SO many plot twists and a LOT of characters died.  Im back into that GOT hype and I cant wait to read A Feast For Crows.  One thing I love about this series is how multidimensional all the characters are.  Cerseis a bitch but we understand why she does what she does and to some extent I respect her.  Daenerys was the bad ass bitch I love Tyrion is awesome as always Jaime was more complicated than he originally appeared Arya was awesome as always Jon was cool as always Catelyn was the bad ass mom she always is Brann has exceedingly become boringer and Sansa well.  With Sansa Im either annoyed at her or I feel sorry for her.  It was both in this book.  Im looking forward to where the story goes after this.,5,False
911, I guess I read this but I never rated it?  Oh well until I reread it Ill just give it  stars.  Original  release date is the th but I bought it today?  What....?,3,False
912, It was o.k.  Maybe its just me but I was annoyed at how Ethan had to mention his undying unyielding eternal love for Lena practically EVERY.OTHER.PAGE.  Like OKAY WE GET IT ETHAN.  YOU LOVE LENA.  WE KNOW.  WEVE READ THREE WHOLE BOOKS ABOUT YOUR GUYS LOVE PRIOR.,3,False
913, Dat Cover Tho.,0,False
914, Not worth anywhere near .  I say it shouldve been free.  Anyways I adore Ridley and Link and I may ship them more than Ethan and Lena now...,2,False
915, Whew what a ride.  I really enjoyed this book much more than the first.  Its very reminiscent of the novellas which I absolutely LOVED so thats a plus.  Honestly Chaol annoyed the shit out of me especially at the end.  I seriously cant tell if Chaol is more loyal to Celaena or to the King.  .  I know Dorian and Celaena wont happen but I still like Dorian more than Chaol.  This book was just plot twist after plot twist after plot twist and I loved every second of it.,5,True
916, Wonder if people rated this book down because they honestly didnt like it or because it wasnt like Harry Potter...  PostReading  First off Id like to give myself a huge pat on the back for finishing this book before Saturday I read approximately  and something pages in about  days so yay!  Anyways this book started off SLOW but after the first  pages it picked up.  And I even became interested in the characters lives!  The book is a tad bit confusing first since Rowling writes the book in like  different perspectives.  Overall  stars.,4,False
917, Im pretty sure anyone who has/will ever read this book will want to take it and slap some sense into Lena with it.  Multiple times.  The book was kind of slowpaced for me but Ridley/Linktotes adorbs and some Liv moments almost made up for it.,4,False
918, Just bought this book.  Bout to read it in a couple months... LEGGO!,0,False
919, . stars.  Saying this book was amazing doesnt even begin to describe it.  However it lagged in some parts and it didnt really pull my heartstrings as much as I thought it would.  I just cant bring myself to give it  stars but still an excellent read none the less.,4,False
920, Original and refreshing not to mention amazing.  I love Marions style of writing and I think Im going to be eagerly awaiting ANY new book he writes.  Even more stoked for the movie now.  Beware of the explicit language in this book though.  Although the only cuss word that is constantly used in this book is the F word its used quite often.  Also not gonna lie there may have been oh two or three parts or  that literally made me LOL and glad that I wasnt reading this in public... / I would give it more stars if I could.,5,False
921, Hate the cover...,0,False
922, . stars.  In my opinion not as good as the first one.  While it was a really quick read nothing really happened.  This book adds alternating povs switching between Ky and Cassia each chapter but frankly you definitely would not be able to differentiate between them unless you read the name at the beginning of the chapters.  Ky doesnt have a distinct voice and sounds EXACTLY the same as Cassia.  So theres that...plus I really wanted to strangle some characters in this book.,3,False
923, Oh my gosh.  Ugh my heart.  Rick Riordan you did it again.,5,False
924, . stars.  I tried to be nice and give this  stars but every time I think about it I groan because of how boring it was.  I can sum it up in  bullet points:  Tris is depressed  Tris suffers from PTSD  Tris and Tobias fight A LOT  Huge revelation at the end that tries to overshadow just how boring the book really is  Seriously the whole book felt like a filler just for the ending.  Suffice to say Im pretty disappointed in this book.,2,False
925, This book is crazy.  Also the main character annoyed me throughout the series yes but even more so in this book.  Like really?  She made THE SAME MISTAKE THREE TIMES.  It was annoying.,4,False
926, . since it dragged on a bit in the middle.  Not my favorite book in the series but still Rick Riordan managed to take me yet again on another wonderful magical journey.  Yes pun intended.,4,False
927, This might be the second anthology that Ive read after Zombies V.S.  Unicorns.  And I LOVED it.  Seriously I genuinely enjoyed all the stories My least favorite was the one by Margaret Stohl was that legit French?.  While some stories were better than others theyre all pretty good.  Seriously though I know for sure which authors I need to check out.  Plus this book reminded me of how much I love fantasy!,5,False
928, . stars... Ok my second Laurie Halse Anderson book...I am so disappointed.  People have raved on and on about her writing mainly because of Speak and now Im wondering if they were just exaggerating.  Anyways first off the cover.  I dont get it.  Can someone explain it to me?  I mean I get that its a twisted pencil but how its relevant is where Im lost.  This book was average at best.  You can definitely tell that a woman wrote this book.  Also Bethany.  What the hell was so special about her that made Tyler so thirsty?,3,False
929, ...Stopped reading at page .  Oh I just have to get this in.  In the book Travis has a nickname for Abby which is Pigeon....yeah let that sink in.  What the fk kind of nickname is that?  And its often shortened so its Pidge.  What.the.hell.kind.of.nickname.is.that?  Its suppose to be sweet and endearing but let me tell you oh let me tell you IT IS NOT.  Its so ridiculous oh my gosh ahahahahahhahahahaThis book is AWFUL.  I was excited to read it because the cover was pretty cool and everyone was just raving about this book.  Boy was I disappointed.  I dont even know where to start.  Lets see the plot was nonexistent and was composed of Abbyprotagonist trying to resist irresistible badboy Travis.  It was completely pointless and stupid.  Abby is attracted to him for nothing other than his supposedly good looks apparently.  The characters were so fucking stupid actually the whole book was so fucking stupid.  Girls are attracted to Travis like moths are attracted to lights.  They throw themselves at him without a second thought and I dont even understand why because the author doesnt explain it and just leaves it at Travis is hot girls want to be with him because hes hot.  Hes not even likable.  Hes disgusting he sleeps with any girl who throws herself at him oh excuse me he doesnt sleep with ugly girls apparently.  Like they legit just throw themselves at him!  Its so unrealistic!  And then of course Abby is the girl who changes his ways cue exaggerated eyeroll.  And Abby is the only girl who doesnt throw herself at him and doesnt want to sleep with him spoiler: she actually does and Travis is just dumbfounded and of course that means he has to find a way to get her to sleep with him.  So Abby pretends shes resistant to his charm when shes not and is just playing hard to get just because.  Like she doesnt even have a reason.  And then whats his face I think its Shep and Amanda are just so fking stupid.  Shep defends Travis and its so.  I cannot even.  UGH.  This book.  There are other reviews that explain it so much better.  Travis isnt worth defending he has no redeeming qualities and Abby is stupid and just ugh.  All the characters in this book are so shallow superficial and onedimensional I just cant.  Like the biggest problem in their lives is relationships.  Just...I cant believe people worship this book and they worship Travis.  You people are the reason theres the misconception that girls only date badboys.  I cant believe any girl could condone his behavior.  Really?  REALLY?  Faith in humanitynonexistent.  Rant over.  for now,1,False
930, The book couldve been a lot better.  I felt as though the author could have gone somewhere with this book but instead she choose the stereotypical cliche route.  Honestly incredibly disappointing and it ruined the whole series for me... My above complaint also explains why I am not happy with who Vlad ended up with.  Like really?  REALLY?  I admit I was rooting for Meredith/Vladmir.  I read this book years ago so I cant really remember the other girls name Snow?  but it was beyond cliche and unoriginal.  I felt as though Meredith wasnt just this stereotypical popular judgmental girly girl at least until this book.  Thats because Ms.  Brewer changed her into someone we would detest so we would like Snow.  IT DIDNT WORK.  not for me at least God it was beyond annoying to read about Snow.  Talk about the stereotypical loner gothic/emoish guy meets vice versa girl.  Rant almost over.  I guess thats my biggest issue with this book the fact that she didnt take any risks and played it too safe and stereotypical.  also the villain.  Really?  Youre gonna make it his dad?  It did not work AT ALL.  It didnt fit the story and it was completely unnecessary and stupid.  Stupid stupid move.  Just my  cents...,1,True
931, I feel as though I should reread this...maybe soon?,1,False
932, . stars.  From the prologue I immediately fell in love with Ms.  Rosenfields writing style.  Seriously its great.  I thought there were a couple of sections that were pretty stagnant and whatnot but nonetheless I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Some moments had me on the edge of my seat and I just HAD to read on to find out what happened.  Also me reading this close to Halloween means that Ive been reading/watching some scary stuff and since this book is like a mystery/thrillerish there were some moments I would look around my room paranoid.  Strong debut if you ask me!  Also this book was really focused on how Becca was struggling with leaving her small town and since I dont really live in a small town I couldnt exactly relate but it was still interesting to read nonetheless.  I wonder if that is how people really feel like?,4,False
933, . stars.  The first half of the book was great.  It was this murder/mystery/whodunit?  kind of thing and I COULD NOT put the book down!  Then theres this HUGE plot twist where I was just like WHAT?!  But alas eventually the shock wears off pretty quickly actually and then the book starts becoming lackluster.  Im not quite sure how I feel about the ending yet...I am disappointed with the second half of the book though.  Time to go watch the movie!,4,False
934, This was much better than the first one.,5,False
935, I loved this book.  There simply isnt any way I could write a review that would sum up my feelings.,5,False
936, . stars.  This book was okay.  The series overall was really disappointing...And Jesus Tobias and Tris were so annoying with their stupid angsty romance.  Christ they had sex like  times in this book...,3,False
937, edit My original rating was  stars but after some contemplation I decided to round it up to  stars.  . stars.  At first I couldnt get into this book almost everyone is a shitty person.  And I found it hard to believe that there was this extremely popular bitch girl who owned the school.  And that there were teachers that shitty.  This is what you see on tv or in books.  Its not real life hopefully.  However I didnt want to stop reading.  Its a very quick book to read and I finished it in a few hours  at best.  Some things dont get as resolved as you wished  Donnie almost raping Regina Regina being a huge fucking bitch all those years and almost no repercussions  .  But the ending is still somewhat satisfying.  Regina was hard to sympathize with you feel bad for her or at least I did but you also kind of hate her.  In a sense she became a victim of her own abuse.  Or as the saying goes you reap what you sow.  The book makes you think when I say that I mean: it made me think does Regina deserve whats happening to her?  Does she deserve kindness?  Personally what does it say about me that I enjoyed her petty revenges.  That I was rooting for her to get back at Anna and Kara?  That I was just as thrilled as she was at playing the same game as Anna and Kara instead of being the bigger person?  That being said I didnt get into this book at first but after a while I couldnt stop reading it.  Also what was up with the romance?  How am I suppose to feel about that?,4,True
938, Expected a light easy read and I got just that.  And so much more...,5,False
939, I guess I didnt track this on goodreads when I first read this so Ill just rate it  stars but I have to reread it.,3,False
940, I loved this book.  The writing is FANTASTIC and GORGEOUS and while the characters werent entirely likable I still rooted for them for the most part.  There were SO MANY swoonworthy lines ugh.  And the ending ugh.  Chapter  ugh.  Damn this book was sad.  And the movie damn.,5,False
941, I swear this took me like a month to read...still it was seriously amazing.  Heathcliff is so unlikable but you just cant help empathizing with him,5,False
942, I liked it but I was a bit disappointed.  Probably because I came into this book with high expectations.  I think I liked this book more than I would have if I hadnt been required to analyze and answer questions on it for English class.  All the symbols motifs and themes probably would have flown over my head.,3,False
943, . stars.  Im actually still unsure whether to rate this  or  stars but Ill just go with  for now but honestly it really is .  This book kind of dragged in the middleend but other than that I was pretty invested.  I mean who isnt interested in romantic drama?  Also while I was reading this all I could think about is the fact that boys were just as much fuckboyy in the early th century as they are today.,4,False
944, After  years I have finally finished this book.  There was a lot of telling not showing.,3,False
945, Probably one of the WORST books I have ever read...EVER.,1,False
946, MY FEELINGS...  the ending was terrible stupid and did not make sense whatsoever.  Like AT ALL.  Basically Maximum Ride was a good series the first  or  books then it all started going downhill from there.  Now about the romance  All you Fax shippers will be happy that they ended up together.  Now me Im incredibly angry.  Fang did nothing to fix his mistakes or make it up to Max and she just accepts him with open arms!  And then Dylan exasperated sigh is a cute innocent puppy who gives Max his love and then she kicks him in the dirt.  REPEATEDLY.!  Seriously Im sure thats where the misconception that Nice Guys Finish Last gets the idea from...Basically if youre looking for closure and an epic ending to a series then this is definitely NOT the book for you.  If you want a halfassed shit ending and terrible romancedepending on who you were rooting for I suppose then well this book sounds like it fits that mold.,1,True
947, Okay.  First off what I didnt like:  the fact that this book felt way too much like a set up for The Dark Artifices  not enough sizzy scenes  way too many povs in the book.  Half of them were just plain unnecessary and just muddled the story and dragged it on  that the book is around  pages and there are times where it really feels like its lagging  the fact that it feels like Im missing out on so many references if Im not caught up in all the shadowhunter facts and family tree and stuff  how Cassandra Clare handled sizzy  how when Mrs.  Clare killed off some characters  Jordan Raphael Maureen etc.  it felt really anticlimatic and nonchalant.  It didnt really have a huge impact or have any effect at all really  the book was really angsty which is fine if there were enough balance and plot to actually balance it out it wasnt  the ending made me furious for a variety of reasons  the fact that when I finished this book I felt worst than before I even started reading it  What I liked:  Jace isnt an annoying arrogant asshole well at least not as much as he is in the other books  Clary isnt as much of a stupid selfish bitch compared to CoLS  Its TMI nostalgia really has an effect  My thoughts:  I feel like Helen and Aline were in the book for a reason.  Like there were a lot of scenes where they were mentioned even if it was for a second or two.  This makes me excited because they seem like a really interesting couple and I hope they play a role in TDA.  Also does anyone even really care about Maia or Jordan?,4,True
948, There were a lot of things in this book that I didnt expect.  The direction it took the mature content and themes  The emphasis on the psychological and physical torture that was happening   that one thing  Adrian and Sydney get married!  HOLY CRAP!  I literally yelled WHAT?  out loud when I read this part.  I totally did NOT see it coming I did however predict the ending even before reading the book.  I predicted this from reading the synopsis for The Ruby Circle so its all good.  The best book in the bloodlines series so far in my opinion.  This book isnt perfect there were a lot of loose ends and questions that I hope arent just left hanging and are answered in the last book but it was pretty damn good.,5,True
949, Kind of sad this is the last book in the VA universe but alas all good things must come to an end.  I really enjoyed this ride.  Also what is it with authors  always bringing back a villain thats supposed to have died or be done with?  I mean it happened in the TMI and a bunch of other works.  Just curious.,5,True
950, Oh my.  I cant even.  Ugh.  I knew I should have waited until the next book came out before I read this one.  I cant even process anything.  Sydney girl Im here for you.  Probably my favorite book from this series so far...Also the cameos  amazing.  I seriously feel like rereading the Vampire Academy series again...maybe I will around the time the movie comes out.  It has a cover!  At first I thought it was just so...awkward.  It still kind of is but its grown on me.  Sydney looks kind of flushed and disheveled which shows just how much shes grown!,5,False
951, Dat ending doe.  Starting from Sydneys revelation to the very end it was amazing.  Faith in this series has been restored after a very disappointed The Golden Lily book.  Cannot wait for The Fiery Heart!  Also I kind of missed seeing Jill in this book.  I know she had her moments but not nearly enough imo.  And having that little snippet with Rose makes me so nostalgic!,5,False
952, So many mixed emotions about this book.  . stars.  I honestly liked the writing and I thought the book was pretty realistic.  What killed it was the ending.  Not so much that it was supposedly a cliffhanger because to me it honestly wasnt but just the ending itself.  Its like this beautiful story with this horrible ending.  I cant really imagine what would happen after he started running.  What would happen to the family and Cami?  I cant imagine how the mom must be feeling.  I felt as though the ending killed me just as it did the mom.  The ending was very abrupt.  It felt like this amazing story and the author just didnt quite knew how to finish it so she cut it off with this crazy ending that just didnt seem to fit in with the book.  Kind of like Lois Duncans books huge fan of her books by the way.  Like the ending snaps you out of the feeling you get when you get absorbed into a book and back into reality.,5,True
953, Postreading.  Welcome back Sarah Dessen.  This book was amazing!  For some reason I felt incredibly attached to Emaline and her problems/pain were my problems/pain at least while reading.  This was an incredible book as compared to her previous one What Happened to Goodbye.  I should probably reread it but I dont recall it being as engaging.  Anyways maybe its the fact that Im older but I really loved how this book seems like its just a romance book but its really not.  In fact the romance takes a back seat.  Anyways excited for what other book she writes up next!  New Sarah Dessen novel!  YES fistpump!  But wait what is this?  The authors name is bigger than the books title!  .... facepalm.  Seriously though am I the only one who hates that?  Anyways super excited for this new novel!,5,False
954, Theres just  something  that prevents the books in this series from getting  stars...,4,False
955, So this book started off kind of slow for me and I know Ive made some flippant comments about it before but honestly this is an important book.  I think everyone should at least attempt to read it once.  It has an important message and Melinda grew on me and as well as a character.  I was rooting for her by the end of the book and I almost shed a single tiny tear at the end of the book.  update Whoa.  Wait.  What?  This book was made into a movie?!  Oh...Kristen Stewart is in it...hmm...,3,False
956, . stars sigh of content Faith in Jennifer Brown restored.  I LOVE Hate List but was EXTREMELY disappointed by Bitter End.  Well after reading this book safe to say she has redeemed herselfat least in my eyes.  This book was pretty predictable and the ending was openended but it was beautifully written and the journey was amazing!  Learned a lot about OCD too!,4,False
957, Well tried to reread it and couldnt finish.  Guess Ill have to try again later.,3,False
958, . stars.  Slow at times but still a great read.,4,False
959, God this novella is depressing...I have to say I totally saw this coming although maybe not the gruesome parts,3,False
960, The book that got me into PJ.  This was my first Percy Jackson book that I read.  I remember being at the library and wanting to find a book to read and seeing this book and remembering reading about how Percy Jackson was being made into a movie or something and deciding to read this book because of that.  One of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.  It introduced me to my favorite book series.  Literally the next day I was at a bookstore and I had my dad spend  on the box set without even knowing what the books were about other than they were Percy Jackson and having no idea whatsoever if I would even like it.,4,False
961, I liked it.  I especially liked the beginning the sarcastic humorous tone of the book and the action.  It got kind of slow in the beginning/middle and the romance was sweet but  kind of sickly because you know it was basically necrophilia  .  What I didnt like was how the beginning high school stuff was cliche the assumption that all a guy has to do is ignore a girl to get her to fall for you and the idea of a stereotypical white blonde prom queen although I actually liked the character.  Also I dont know how to feel about the ending.  But theres a sequel so.,4,True
962, Was disappointed in this book.  Like many others have already said the way Maas describes Celeana it seems like shes ass kicking kindacold heartedish BAMF.  But the Celeana we read isnt that sure she has her moments but for the most part its HUGE tellingnotshowing.  For the full experience I HIGHLY suggest reading the novellas first!  You wont regret it :D seriously I enjoyed the novellas more than this book.  still looking forward to the next one.  Also let it be known that I read this book around right when it came out and I PREDICT CHAOL WILL END UP WITH CELAENA IN THE END.  Thats right I can already tell Chaol will end up with her and I will feel shamelessly vindicated when this happens in the end.  But Im Team Dorian anyways :p,3,False
963, nd readthrough: . stars.  Every time I reread an Ellen Hopkins novel I notice something new about the formatting that I didnt notice before or maybe I did notice but just didnt mention it?.  For example during my second read through of this book about / of the way through I realized or rerealized?  that each of the  narrators have different formatting for their POV!  How cool is that!  It always amazes me how Ellen Hopkins can write books like these it must take an insane amount of attention to detail.,3,False
964, I like to call this book the mind fuck book...,5,False
965, DNF  read up to page .  I tried.  I just cant do it.  This book is just so BORING.  I dont care about any of the characters especially Amy who is narrating the book.  The story is supposedly some journey to self healing and reself discovery but I read / of the book and the journey has barely even begun.  I dont understand what all the hype is about and I wish I gave up earlier instead of wasting my time trying to power through this.  I should have known this book sucked since the beginning.,1,False
966, Holy shit.  Oh my gosh.  That ending.  It was so EPIC.  The story was epic and the characters were fleshed out and wellwritten.  There was never a boring part and I think I really need to start watching the show at least season  so I can actually see the epic battles and sword fights taking place.  The hype for this book is well placed.  So many plot twists.  A lot of political intrigue that I wasnt expecting but very much enjoyed.  Looking forward to the next books.,5,False
967, I remember reading this in th grade...I shall reread it one day,4,False
968, I didnt like this book.  I didnt like the plot the characters the main character or the love interest.  Actually Biancas best friends were probably the most likable people in this book.  Bianca is such a judgmental bitch.  And she has this insane inferiority complex throughout the whole book.  The characters are all really one dimensional and it was really hard to feel sympathy for  her having to deal with her parents divorce  .  The synopsis sounded interesting but the book itself however is not.  Im disappointed.  I was expecting so much more and I kept reading because of some naive misguided hope that it would get better It didnt.  sigh I only pushed through it because in the movie theyre making they casted Robbie Amell swoon as Wesely.  And hes like my biggest celebrity crush ever since he was on Life With Derek.  Ahh enough about my life story.  I simply didnt care for nor like this book in the slightest and Bianca is so unlikable how can you root for her?  I couldnt.  Also the characters seemed so unrealistic.  Seriously.,1,True
969, Im conflicted on how many stars to rate this book.  Overall ..  It was a nice read and its pretty strong considering this is Ms.  Fitzpatricks debut novel.  BUT its nothing I havent read before.  Oh sure there was that one twist  when whats her faces mom hits Jases father.  I just finished the book and I forgot the main characters name... looked it up and its Sam.  but its still the same story boy meets girl or more accurately girl meets boy boy and girl fall in love either boy or girl does something or something happens then they break up and one of them is heartbroken in the end boy and girl reconcile and fall happily in love.  The end.  Dont mean to sell this book short but its nothing new to me.  is still my quintessential summer romance book this year.  This book is still worth reading though I mean IT HAS A LARA CROFT REFERENCE!,3,True
970, I came up with a new shelf because of this book Annoying protagonists.  This book was really quick and easy to read.  My main problem is Ann is so naive and dense that I was literally raising my voice at the book... Seriously she could have saved all that trouble by killing mr.  loomis.  She just let him come in HER home literally and SHE was the one who left.  She let him come and take over everything she had and she let him run her out.  .  There was one part where I laughed not necessarily because it was meant to be funny maybe it was but I doubt it but because it was just so stupid.  where Faro was tracking her to the cave and she realized that she had to kill no not Mr.  Loomis the guy who was making her life a living hell but the dog who didnt even realize anything was wrong.  EXTREME MELODRAMATIC SIGH shaking of the head  .  Heard theyre making a movie with Amanda Seyfried and Chris Pine cant wait to watch it!,3,True
971, . stars.  The ending kind of reminded me of Lord of the Flies...,4,False
972, Its  in the morning and Im happy/sad crying.  I love this book.,5,False
973, Aww fluffyness level max.  Oh and the protagonist has some raging hormones...,4,False
974, I loved loved loved loved loved loved LOVED this book.  Katsa was such a BAMF and Po was extremely likable and Bitterblue was already a BAMFintraining.  Also the antagonist was really well done.  I sincerely despise him and reading the prologue of Fire intensifies this.  Well done Ms.  Cashore!  It is about time I read this.  Its been on my toread list far too long think  years!  No more putting it off.  Its time.,5,False
975, Team Jem...or I will burn the book and throw it against the wall.  During reading  Found  typos on page  and on page .  Mrs.  Clare seems to have mixed up Gabriel and Gideon :p  Post Reading Welp the cover is beautiful and that in itself is enough to give the book at least  stars...  ...OH MY GOD.  MY FEELS!  This book is certainly the best of both worlds  I mean come on she ends up with BOTH Will AND Jem?  And it was adorable with both of them?  Though a nagging part of me feels like slutshaming her I understand that her love for them is equal.  I feel like she wrote it as a cheap shot to keep both sides happy.  Anyways lets talk about other relationships.  Gabriel and Cecily anyone?  OMG They are ADORABLE.  Favorite couple besides Jem and Tessa.  Also I actually didnt mind Will in this book.  I KNEW she was going to end up with Will she technically did and it says on the family tree too but I didnt expect her to also end up with Jem...its too good to be true.  Seriously this was too much for my feels to handle.,4,True
976, OH MY GOSH.  I just finished the book and am still reeling from it.  .ish stars.  I loved the lore in this book.  The reason this book isnt rated higher is because it took forever to get interesting.  I literally could not get into it until around page  where  Madrigal and the wishbone situation was finally introduced.  .  Seriously I didnt care about Karou at all and it was only slightly interesting when she and Akiva finally met.  But man oh man.  When the story becomes about  Madrigal   ... Wow.  I definitely would have liked this book more if there were less Karou and more  Madrigal  .  More M and less Karou would have been amazing.  This book was like it rollercoaster: it takes FOREVER to get to the climax but when it does...it doesnt stop or slow down and you want MORE.  The romance is definitely the best aspect of this book.  Which is disappointing b/c the author tries to bring other subplots to support the main romance one but theyre extremely weak.,4,True
977, Favorite book in the series.,5,False
978, The first time I read this I rated it  stars because before I read it my friends told me that people thought it wasnt as good as the previous books.  Stupidly I let others opinions influence me before I even read it.  I reread it a second time and it is  fucking brilliant .,5,False
979, Hey!  No pointless love triangle?  YES PLEASE!  :D,5,False
980, . stars.  A very strong debut novel.  The premise was interesting and I was looking forward to reading this book.  I cant believe it took me  years since first adding this to my toread list to finally read it.  But I have so yay for me.  I really like June and I think shes kick ass.  Days pretty awesome too but I enjoyed Junes povs more.  Im also iffy about the romance  it just didnt seem that organic/believable to me.  Lets be real it totally wasnt but Im not saying I want slow burn I just want something that cultivates after a little more time and experience spent together and a little more getting to know you instead of the instantattractionIdontknowwhybutImjustdrawntoyou type thing.  Thankfully the romance wasnt that big of a thing so it wasnt too bad.  The beginning started off kind of slow in my opinion but as everyone else says the rest of the book is pretty fast paced and I didnt want to put it down.  I agree with someone calling this book a little too formulaic which is pretty true since thats what I thought when I finished the book.  It follows the very tried and true but still awesome format of YA dystopian fiction.  Im a little disappointed the book ended where it did  I was kind of hoping more would happen but I know the authors saving that for the rest of the trilogy.  I hope the nd and rd book are just as good as this book because honestly YA dystopian trilogies have a tendency to have a kick ass first novel but then once the dystopian world has been established the nd and rd novel usually tend to take a completely different direction and end up being disappointing cough looking at you Divergent trilogy cough.  Im excited to read the next two books.  Heres to hoping theyre just as good.  P.S.  Yay for Asian representation!  Universe knows we need more of it!,4,False
981, Couldnt finish it.  I was / of the way done with the book and I just had to put it down because it was so boring.  Nothing exciting happened and I felt like the book was dragging.,1,False
982, Probably  of the characters annoyed the crap out of me and I had to make myself suffer through the book because I have to finish reading a book I start.  Overall it was okay it wasnt mindblowing or incredibly amazing but it was a nice read.  The plot wasnt original but the author somehow made it seem less cliche that it really was.  The ending is pretty openended though the only thing that was set in stone was  Anna and St.  Clair ending up together which come on you have to be a thickheaded person to not think that they would end up together from since the beginning of the book.  We dont know what happened to Amanda and Dave and Bridgette which I really wanted to know because although she wasnt a major character she didnt really annoy me as much and I liked her and all that good stuff  .  The authors writing was confusing at some parts i.e.  time passes by like say a day and we are unaware of it and are completely caught off guard when the next chapter just abruptly switches to a different location and topic ect.,2,True
983, . stars.  Was this book mindblowing?  No.  Did it change my life?  No.  Was it funny and quirky?  Not particularly.  Did I enjoy it nonetheless?  Yes.  Its a book that offers insight into the world of mental illness and considering Im majoring in psychology fits.  I do have to say though that the synopsis made the book sound more interesting than it is.,3,False
984, I LOVED Hate List by Jennifer Brown so when I found out that she wrote a second novel I knew I just HAD to read it.  Boy was I disappointed.  The book starts off interesting enough but once Cole Alexs new found boyfriend starts showing signs of abuse and possessiveness the book just goes downhill.  Alexs best friends are loveable but once she starts dating Cole you just want to strangle them!  The book was pretty slow and didnt have much going for it besides the abusive boyfriend plot nothing interesting really happened.  Id recommend this book for anyone who is interested in a young adult book about abusive relationships but only if you have nothing better to read.  There are SO many other abusive relationship books that are x better.  Honestly I kind of wished that I hadnt read this because it was just such a step back from Hate List.  All I can do is eagerly await Jennifer Browns next novel and hope that it leans more towards a Hate List kind of book.,3,False
985, I was gonna give this book  stars but I decided on  because justifying attempted rape is never o.k.  I felt like this book set out to be one of those deep pretentious books that set out to give you life lessons.  I will admit that it did a good job of not being pretentious.  It was extremely emotionally manipulative however.,2,False
986, Let me just say that before I read this book I liked to think of myself and neutral and leaning toward Team Unicorn...Now postreading of this book it is safe to say that I am Team Zombie.  The zombie stories were brilliant and excellent the unicorn stories with the exception of  stories were just plain horrible and stupid.,3,False
987, How do I even begin to describe this book?  I love it so much.  I love Markus Zusaks writing style.  This book if I had to describe it in one word is charming.  The writing is charming the characters are charming the story is charming.  The book is charming.  This book is the kind that you just cant rush through.  I admit sometimes I start skimming through books.  I tried to do it with this book.  Big mistake.  First what was I thinking trying to skim parts of this?  No.  This book requires you to take your time and read it at the books pace.  You cant rush it.  You have to read each and every word because every single word is important.  But you will enjoy it immensely.  The characters truly shine in this story.  No matter how unlikable they are or seem to be.  I loved every.  single.  one.  My favorites just might be Rudy and Ilsaa.k.a the mayors wife.  Near the end of the book I started bawling.  I was crying so hard.  And I loved it.  I loved that this book evoked that emotion out of me.  In fact I was so overwhelmed that I just had to put the book down and cry.  I had to stop reading put my head down and just cry.  I would then compose myself and start again  only to read the next sentence or two and just burst out in tears again.  Part of it because the sentence made me cry.  And part of it because I was still overwhelmed and the sentence pushed me over the edge so to speak again.  This is a book that will make me reel.  Ill need days to recover from this book.,5,False
988, Wow.  What a ride.  Im so pleasantly impressed by this book.  I came in expecting this to be another YA dystopian novel  and it is  but its so much more.  In fact it reads more like a fantasy novel including the large world building and huge adventure the protagonist goes on.  I didnt like the beginning of the book the writing took a while to get used to and it was just really slow in the beginning.  I also felt like Patrick Ness dragged out the secret of how boys turn into men a little too long.  Also the whole  if we can turn you into a killer Todd Hewitt that proves well be able to turn anyone!  thing was so stupid.  Theres just not a lot of sense and rationality in that line of thinking which may be the point but to make that the driving plot point well it just doesnt really work.  I was surprised to see the length of the book but like I said its almost a fantasy book.  In fact this book really reminds me of the video game Fallout .  All I could think about was Todd being the main character in this postapocalyptic world filled with moral ambiguity and a shit ton of guns and killing.  Its pretty great and very fitting.  It took a while to warm up to this book but Im very eager to start reading the second book!  Also theyre making a movie with Tom Holland Daisy Ridley and a bunch of other well known celebrity actors.  Im impressed with the cast.,4,True
989, I feel like I would have appreciated this book even more if I read A Wrinkle in Time beforehand.  Anyways I wasnt really feeling the  time travel stuff   but everything else the friendship/family dynamics were A.,4,True
990, I need time to process this... . stars  Okay.  I LOVED this book.  Daniel Handlers writing is unique and its great!  The characters were mostly likable and the whole story/romance didnt come off as unrealistic to me.  Of course we all know that Ed and Min broke up and the reason why isnt exactly original or jawdropping but when  we find out Ed cheated on Min   well damn.  I felt just as equally heart broken and betrayed as Min did.  And if I read a book and it can evoke real emotions out of me like that or make me feel like the protagonist does well then I have complete and utter respect for the author.  I immensely wanted to buy this book while I was reading it honestly I developed a little sweet crush on Ed myself but when I finished I didnt have the feeling of wanting to reread it anymore because I felt betrayed  by Ed  .  Still I think Ill pick this book up next time Im at the book store : Also some sentences were kind of confusing but it makes sense I suppose since this whole book is a letter written from Min who is just a high school student and therefore perfection cannot be expected.  See Im pretty sure that sentence I just wrote is wrong.,4,True
991, I would probably rate this book  stars.  Okay so lets start this review first off I loved how the author was able to have several different subplots going on at once with all the different characters and not have it all end up in confusion.  She pulled it off which is probably a hard thing to do but she did it.  Thats not to say that I didnt have any issues with this book because there were a lot.  First off it was pretty inconsistent now that I think about it.  Its just the little things like for example  Simon and Isabelles relationship.  Honestly I thought they were already dating by the time this book started but no they were still in the confusion zone of almost boyfriend and girlfriend but not quite there yet.  Really?  Like even at the end of the book after all the intimate moments they shared theyre STILL not dating?  And neither of them is apparently bright enough to figure out that they both love each other?  Did the stuff that happened in the previous books not matter either?  Thats not to say that their relationship was probably the saving grace of this book for me...  .  Also the author uses the same adjectives/phrases for probably every character.  Honestly how many times do you need to tell us Jace is golden or Sebastian has Valentines hair and it suits him better than when he dyed it black?  And Clary and Jace.  Just...really?  REALLY?  They were beyond annoying for most of this book although there WERE some moments in which they were tolerable.  Clary was SO selfish and their romance just resembles Edwards and Bellas from Twilight so much.  Jace: I hurt you I cant be with you anymore now even though I love  you and want to be with you!  Its all my fault that you got hurt!  Mind you that I had this annoyance since the start of the series surprisingly Jace wasnt the culprit in this book though!  Clary: I dont care if you want to die!  I love you too much and im so selfish that im going to make everything worse!  Im going to ignore what everyone tells me to do because I cant lose you I love you so much that I cant live without you!  Really Clary?  sarcasm How did you possibly survive before Jace came into your life?  Clary was fine throughout the series but recently shes starting to annoy the crap out of me.  I have mixed feelings about how the author wrote about one couple or some group of characters and their adventure and then end the chapter on a cliffhanger.  And then the next chapter...SURPRISE!  starts right off with a different group of characters...like how she wrote about Simon and Isabelle and then suddenly alternates back to Jace and Clary...Although at first I was incredibly annoyed eventually I would warm up and start to get sucked into an adventure only to have the whole process repeat itself.  But honestly Isabelle and Simon...DAWWWW THEYRE SO CUTE!  Favorite couple are they even an official couple?  from the series!,3,True
992, I was debating on whether or not to give this book  or  starts.  I decided  because I just loved Vampire Academy and Richelle Mead but this book certainly is NOWHERE NEAR her best.  First the book was SO predictable.  I knew from Bloodlines that Adrian and Sydney would be the books main couple just like Rose and Dimitri from VA.  facepalm Sydney is supposedly smart so you know that she would catch on pretty quickly to what was going to happen/what was happening right?  Nope.  She is like a slug in figuring things out SLOW.  About / through the book I had already guessed on what was going to happen and I was correct.  The book honestly didnt have much going for it incredibly predictable from close to the beginning all the way to the ending.  On the bright side I just LOVED Adrians love confession even though it was borderline cliche I believe he somewhat pulled it off :.,3,True
993, So I really enjoyed like the first / of the book and I definitely would have gave it a solid  stars until I got near the ending and John Green started writing his stupid annoying metaphors.  That itself is enough to merit a full drop of one star from a  star book to a  star book.  The ending just kind of sucked.  The last paragraph itself is fine and kind of cute but the ending is where John Green just starts taking over and instead of the characters talking its just John Green talking to the reader to get across a philosophical pretentious life theme.  Seriously like once Margo started spewing out stuff about paper towns and paper girls at the end I was gone and I didnt want to come back.  I felt like Margos characterization was choppy and one could argue thats cause we see her from Qs point of view but I blame it on poor execution.  Basically I enjoyed the first half of the story it kind of dragged in the middle and the ending sucked.,3,False
994, ...disappointed at all the hype this book had but I guess it just wasnt the book for me.  If I had to describe it in one word PRETENTIOUS.  Also it didnt help that halfway through the book I was extremely bored and I had to FORCE myself to finish it...maybe Im missing something?,1,False
995, It was an easy quick read.  Heard some good things about it so Id thought Id check it out.  Was pretty disappointed after I read the book.  It isnt all that great and there were many times where I just wanted to strangle the main character for being so slow and dumb and unable to comprehend the events that were clearly happening right in front of her.  I didnt understand where the book was going with the romance one moment one guy would be just friends with her and then all of sudden he suddenly decides that he is in love with her.  Overall just like my rating shows the book was o.k.,2,False
996, R.I.P.  Ms.  Harper Lee Feb.  Thank you for writing one of the great American novels.,4,False
997, I didnt like it as much as the other Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus books but still it was an easy and enjoyable read.,3,False
998, a beautiful book beautiful illustrations and a really nice story,5,False
999,  or  stars  the book couldnt really capture my attention although the story wasnt boring.  I only read The Turn of the Screw not The Aspern Papers.,3,False
